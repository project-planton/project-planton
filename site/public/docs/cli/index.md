# CLI Documentation

Everything you need to know about the `project-planton` command-line interface.

---

## Overview

The Project Planton CLI is your gateway to deploying infrastructure across any cloud provider with a consistent, manifest-driven workflow. Whether you prefer Pulumi or OpenTofu as your IaC engine, the CLI experience is identical.

---

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install project-planton/tap/project-planton

# Verify installation
project-planton version
```

### Quick Example

```bash
# Validate your manifest
project-planton validate -f database.yaml

# Deploy with unified kubectl-style command (recommended)
project-planton apply -f database.yaml

# Destroy with unified command
project-planton destroy -f database.yaml

# Or use provisioner-specific commands
project-planton pulumi up -f database.yaml
project-planton tofu apply -f database.yaml
```

## Choose Your IaC Engine

### Pulumi

**Best for**:
- Teams preferring programming languages over HCL
- Complex logic and control flow
- Type safety and IDE autocomplete
- Real-time outputs during deployment

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires Pulumi backend (Pulumi Cloud, S3, GCS, etc.)
- Smaller community than Terraform
- Modules written in Go (for Project Planton)

### OpenTofu

**Best for**:
- Teams with existing Terraform experience
- Declarative infrastructure-as-code preference
- Larger ecosystem and community
- HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)

**Trade-offs**:
- Less flexible for complex logic
- State management is more manual
- No real-time output streaming

**The good news**: Project Planton supports both! You can switch between them based on your team's preference. The manifest format is identical—only the deployment command changes.

## Common Workflows

### First-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Install CLI
brew install project-planton/tap/project-planton

# 2. Install IaC engine
brew install pulumi        # For Pulumi
# OR
brew install opentofu      # For OpenTofu

# 3. Configure credentials (see Credentials Guide)
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."

# 4. Create your first manifest
cat > database.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsRdsInstance
metadata:
  name: my-database
  labels:
    project-planton.org/provisioner: pulumi
spec:
  engine: postgres
  instanceClass: db.t3.medium
EOF

# 5. Deploy (kubectl-style!)
project-planton apply -f database.yaml
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Morning: pull latest manifests
git pull

# Edit manifest
vim ops/resources/api-deployment.yaml

# Validate changes
project-planton validate -f ops/resources/api-deployment.yaml

# Deploy with unified command (auto-detects provisioner)
project-planton apply -f ops/resources/api-deployment.yaml

# Evening: commit changes
git add ops/resources/api-deployment.yaml
git commit -m "scale: increase API replicas"
git push
```
