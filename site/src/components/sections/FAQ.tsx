      question: "Is this just another abstraction layer that hides cloud-specific details?",
      answer:
        "No. Project Planton manifests are deliberately provider-specific (AWS RDS has different fields than GCP Cloud SQL). The framework provides consistency in structure and workflow, not artificial abstractions that leak complexity. You write the exact configuration your cloud provider needs, just in a standardized YAML format.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this locked to a SaaS platform?",
      answer:
        "No. Project Planton is a standalone CLI tool with zero SaaS dependencies. Your manifests, your credentials, your infrastructure. Everything runs locally or in your CI/CD. There's no platform to sign up for, no API to call, no vendor to depend on.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why would I use this instead of just learning Terraform or Pulumi?",
      answer:
        "If you're deploying across multiple clouds, you'll end up learning Terraform AND Pulumi AND cloud-specific nuances anyway. Project Planton gives you battle-tested modules, strong validation, and consistent workflow so you can focus on your infrastructure requirements, not tooling complexity.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need to customize beyond what the modules provide?",
      answer:
        "All Pulumi and Terraform modules are open source and forkable. Point --module-dir at your fork. Or use the manifests as validated input and call the modules directly from your own IaC code. You're never locked in.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need Pulumi/Terraform knowledge to get started?",
      answer:
        "Not to start. You work with declarative manifests; the CLI selects and executes the appropriate Pulumi or OpenTofu modules for you. But knowledge of these tools helps when you need deeper customization.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which cloud providers are supported today?",
      answer:
        "AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, plus Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Civo, Confluent, MongoDB Atlas, and more. Browse the full catalog at /docs/catalog to see all 100+ deployment components across 8 providers.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are configuration errors caught before deployment?",
      answer:
        "Each manifest is validated against Protobuf schemas with field-level rules (via Buf ProtoValidate, including CEL expressions). Running 'project-planton validate' catches errors immediately with clear messages—before any cloud APIs are called.",
    },
    {
      question: "Where is infrastructure state stored?",
      answer:
        "Project Planton creates no state management abstractions—it uses the native mechanisms of your chosen IaC engine. With OpenTofu, you configure backends (local, S3, GCS, azurerm) directly via tofu init. With Pulumi, you use standard Pulumi backends (Pulumi Cloud, S3, GCS, or local filesystem) configured via pulumi login. Whatever backend configuration you set in your environment is what gets used. You have complete control over where and how state is stored.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do credentials work?",
      answer:
        "Provider credentials are read from environment variables (e.g., AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS, KUBECONFIG). The CLI uses standard cloud provider authentication mechanisms. Optionally, you can pass credential file paths via flags like --aws-credential or --gcp-credential. Credentials never leave your local environment.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I run this in CI/CD?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Install the CLI and your chosen engine (Pulumi or OpenTofu), provide credentials as files or secrets, then run the same commands you use locally. Works in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or any CI system.",
    },
