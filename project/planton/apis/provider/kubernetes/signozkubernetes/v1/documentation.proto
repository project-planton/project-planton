//# Overview
//
//The **SigNoz Kubernetes API Resource** provides a consistent and standardized interface for deploying and managing SigNoz instances on Kubernetes clusters within our infrastructure. This resource simplifies the process of setting up observability for applications, enabling users to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their applications effectively.
//
//## Purpose
//
//We developed this API resource to streamline the deployment and configuration of SigNoz on Kubernetes clusters. By offering a unified interface, it reduces the complexity involved in setting up observability tools, allowing users to:
//
//- **Monitor Applications**: Gain insights into application performance through metrics, logs, and traces.
//- **Simplify Deployment**: Abstract the complexities of setting up SigNoz, including resource allocation and access controls.
//- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Use existing Kubernetes cluster credentials and integrate with other Kubernetes resources.
//- **Optimize Performance**: Identify bottlenecks and improve application performance with real-time data.
//- **Focus on Development**: Allow developers to concentrate on building features rather than managing observability infrastructure.
//
//## Key Features
//
//- **Consistent Interface**: Aligns with our existing APIs for deploying open-source software, microservices, and cloud infrastructure.
//- **Simplified Deployment**: Automates the provisioning of SigNoz instances, including necessary configurations and resource settings.
//- **Observability Tools**: Provides monitoring, logging, and tracing capabilities in a unified platform.
//- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Kubernetes clusters using provided credentials.
//- **Scalability**: Supports scaling to accommodate the monitoring needs of growing applications.
//
//## Use Cases
//
//- **Application Performance Monitoring**: Track the performance of applications to ensure optimal user experience.
//- **Troubleshooting and Debugging**: Quickly identify and resolve issues in production and staging environments.
//- **Microservices Monitoring**: Monitor complex microservices architectures with distributed tracing.
//- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Keep an eye on Kubernetes cluster health and resource utilization.
//- **Compliance and Reporting**: Generate reports for compliance audits and performance reviews.
//
//## Future Enhancements
//
//As this resource is currently in a partial implementation phase, future updates will include:
//
//- **Advanced Configuration Options**: Support for custom dashboards, alerting rules, and data retention policies.
//- **Enhanced Security Features**: Integration with Kubernetes RBAC and secret management for secure deployments.
//- **Monitoring and Logging**: Improved support for logging, tracing, and monitoring using Kubernetes-native tools.
//- **Automation and CI/CD Integration**: Streamlined processes for integrating with continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
//- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Expanded usage examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guides.
