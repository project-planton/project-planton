//# Overview
//
//The **Argo CD Kubernetes API Resource** provides a consistent and standardized interface for deploying and managing Argo CD instances on Kubernetes clusters within our infrastructure. This resource simplifies the process of setting up continuous delivery pipelines, allowing users to automate application deployments and manage application lifecycles efficiently.
//
//## Purpose
//
//We developed this API resource to streamline the deployment and configuration of Argo CD on Kubernetes clusters. By offering a unified interface, it reduces the complexity involved in setting up GitOps workflows, enabling users to:
//
//- **Automate Application Deployment**: Utilize Argo CD to continuously deploy applications from Git repositories to Kubernetes clusters.
//- **Simplify Configuration**: Abstract the complexities of setting up Argo CD, including resource allocation and access controls.
//- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Use existing Kubernetes cluster credentials and integrate with other Kubernetes resources.
//- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Configure CPU and memory resources for the Argo CD container to suit performance needs.
//- **Focus on Development**: Allow developers to concentrate on writing code rather than managing deployment processes.
//
//## Key Features
//
//- **Consistent Interface**: Aligns with our existing APIs for deploying open-source software, microservices, and cloud infrastructure.
//- **Simplified Deployment**: Automates the provisioning of Argo CD instances, including necessary configurations and resource settings.
//- **Resource Configuration**: Allows customization of CPU and memory resources for the Argo CD container.
//- **Ingress Support**: Provides options to configure ingress specifications for network routing and access.
//- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with Kubernetes clusters using provided credentials.
//
//## Use Cases
//
//- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Implement GitOps practices by syncing Kubernetes clusters with Git repositories.
//- **Multi-Cluster Management**: Deploy and manage applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters efficiently.
//- **Application Lifecycle Management**: Streamline the process of deploying, updating, and rolling back applications.
//- **Infrastructure as Code**: Maintain cluster and application configurations in version-controlled repositories.
//- **Development and Testing**: Set up consistent environments for development, staging, and testing deployments.
//
//## Future Enhancements
//
//As this resource is currently in a partial implementation phase, future updates will include:
//
//- **Advanced Configuration Options**: Support for additional Argo CD settings, plugins, and customization.
//- **Enhanced Security Features**: Integration with Kubernetes RBAC and secret management for secure deployments.
//- **Monitoring and Logging**: Improved support for logging, tracing, and monitoring using Kubernetes-native tools.
//- **Automation and CI/CD Integration**: Streamlined processes for integrating with continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
//- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Expanded usage examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guides.
