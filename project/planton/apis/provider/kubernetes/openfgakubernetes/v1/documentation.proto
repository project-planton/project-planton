//# Overview
//
//The **OpenFGA Kubernetes API resource** is designed to provide a streamlined interface for deploying OpenFGA, an open-source authorization system, in a Kubernetes environment. This API resource handles the configuration of the OpenFGA container, its resource allocation, ingress settings, and data store connection, ensuring a consistent and secure deployment across different environments.
//
//## Why We Created This API Resource
//
//Deploying OpenFGA in Kubernetes can involve complex configurations, especially when managing resources, ingress rules, and data store connections. This API resource simplifies the process by:
//
//- **Simplifying Deployment**: Abstracts the complexity of Kubernetes configurations for OpenFGA.
//- **Ensuring Consistency**: Provides a standardized way to deploy OpenFGA across multiple environments.
//- **Optimizing Resource Management**: Allows for fine-tuning resource allocation (CPU and memory) for the OpenFGA container.
//- **Enabling Flexible Data Store Options**: Supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL for OpenFGA data storage.
//
//## Key Features
//
//### Environment Integration
//
//- **Environment Info**: Integrates with Planton Cloud's environment management system to deploy OpenFGA in a specific environment.
//- **Stack Job Settings**: Supports stack job settings to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments using infrastructure-as-code.
//
//### Kubernetes Credential Management
//
//- **Kubernetes Cluster Credential ID**: Specifies the Kubernetes credentials (`kubernetes_cluster_credential_id`) for securely deploying and managing the OpenFGA container within a Kubernetes cluster.
//
//### OpenFGA Container Configuration
//
//#### Resource Management
//
//- **Container Resources**: Allows configuration of CPU and memory limits to optimize the performance of the OpenFGA container. Recommended default values:
//- **CPU Requests**: `50m`
//- **Memory Requests**: `256Mi`
//- **CPU Limits**: `1`
//- **Memory Limits**: `1Gi`
//
//- **Replicas**: Define the number of replicas for the OpenFGA container, providing high availability and fault tolerance.
//
//### Ingress Configuration
//
//- **Ingress Spec**: Configures ingress rules to expose the OpenFGA service to external clients, allowing secure access to the OpenFGA API.
//
//### Data Store Configuration
//
//- **Engine**: Specifies the type of data store engine to use for OpenFGA, with support for both MySQL and PostgreSQL.
//- Supported engines: `"postgres"` and `"mysql"`
//
//- **URI**: Defines the connection URI for the selected data store engine. The URI should be appropriately formatted based on the engine type (e.g., `mysql://user:password@host:port/database` or `postgres://user:password@host:port/database`).
//
//## Benefits
//
//- **Simplified Deployment**: Reduces the complexities of deploying OpenFGA on Kubernetes with a standardized and easy-to-use API resource.
//- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent deployment of OpenFGA across different environments and clusters.
//- **Resource Optimization**: Allows for fine-tuning resource allocations to optimize performance and cost-efficiency.
//- **Data Store Flexibility**: Supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL as data store engines, providing flexibility in database management.
//- **Secure Access**: Configures ingress rules for secure and controlled access to the OpenFGA instance.
