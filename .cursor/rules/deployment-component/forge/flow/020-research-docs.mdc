RULE NUMBER
020

TITLE
Forge: Generate Research Documentation (v1/docs/README.md)

ROLE
You are the Project Planton Code Partner working inside the developer's local workspace in Cursor. This rule generates the comprehensive research document that explains the deployment landscape, rationale, and best practices for a cloud resource.

SCOPE
- Target: `apis/org/project_planton/provider/<provider>/<kindfolder>/v1/docs/README.md`
- Create comprehensive technical research document
- This is different from v1/README.md (user-facing overview)
- This is the deep-dive document that justifies design decisions

PURPOSE
The research document (v1/docs/README.md) serves multiple purposes:
1. **Landscape Analysis** - Survey all deployment methods from manual to automated
2. **80/20 Rationale** - Explain which features were included and why
3. **Best Practices** - Document production-ready patterns
4. **Historical Context** - Explain the evolution of the technology
5. **Comparison** - Show how Project Planton compares to other approaches

**CRITICAL:** This document becomes the **primary source of truth** for the component. It will be consulted when:
- **Updating** the component (understand design decisions)
- **Auditing** the component (assess research quality)
- **Deleting** the component (understand impact)
- **Making decisions** about component behavior

**Generate this document with high quality and completeness** - it's not just documentation, it's the knowledge base for the component.

PREREQUISITES
- spec.proto exists and defines the resource configuration
- stack_outputs.proto exists and defines outputs
- api.proto exists with full resource definition
- Component purpose and provider are known

SEQUENTIAL STEPS

1) **Gather Context**
   - Read spec.proto to understand what fields are exposed
   - Read stack_outputs.proto to understand what's provisioned
   - Read api.proto for complete resource structure
   - Identify the provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.)
   - Identify the resource type (database, compute, storage, networking, etc.)

2) **Research Structure**
   
   Generate a document with the following sections:
   
   **Introduction** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What the component is
   - Why it matters
   - The problem it solves
   - How Project Planton approaches it
   
   **Evolution / Historical Context** (3-5 paragraphs)
   - How the technology evolved
   - Different approaches over time
   - Why the current state is complex
   - What problems led to Project Planton's abstraction
   
   **Deployment Methods Landscape** (Main section - substantial)
   
   For each deployment method, provide:
   - **Level 0: Manual (Cloud Console)**
     - Step-by-step workflow
     - Pros and cons
     - When to use
     - Verdict
   
   - **Level 1: CLI (gcloud/aws/az commands)**
     - Example commands
     - Pros and cons
     - When to use
     - Verdict
   
   - **Level 2: IaC (Terraform)**
     - Example terraform code
     - Pros and cons
     - When to use
     - Verdict
   
   - **Level 3: IaC (Pulumi)**
     - Example Pulumi code
     - Pros and cons
     - When to use
     - Verdict
   
   - **Other Methods** (if applicable)
     - Ansible, Crossplane, Helm, etc.
     - Brief analysis
   
   **Comparative Analysis**
   - Table comparing all methods
   - Key differences highlighted
   - Trade-offs explained
   
   **The Project Planton Approach**
   - How Project Planton's abstraction works
   - What it automates
   - What it simplifies
   - The 80/20 principle application
   - Why certain fields were included
   - Why certain fields were excluded
   - API design decisions
   
   **Implementation Landscape**
   - How it's actually implemented under the hood
   - Pulumi module architecture
   - Terraform module architecture
   - Key resources created
   - Dependencies and relationships
   
   **Production Best Practices**
   - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
   - Recommended configurations
   - Security considerations
   - Performance considerations
   - Cost optimization
   - Monitoring and alerting
   
   **Conclusion**
   - Summary of benefits
   - When to use this component
   - References to official documentation

3) **Content Quality Guidelines**
   
   - **Length**: 300-1000+ lines (substantial document)
   - **Depth**: Go beyond marketing material, provide technical insights
   - **Examples**: Include real code snippets (not pseudocode)
   - **Comparisons**: Be fair but show why Project Planton's approach is better
   - **Opinionated**: Make clear recommendations
   - **Actionable**: Readers should understand what to do
   - **Well-Structured**: Use clear headings, bullet points, tables
   - **Research-Backed**: Reference official docs when possible

4) **Write the Document**
   
   Create the file at: `apis/org/project_planton/provider/<provider>/<kindfolder>/v1/docs/README.md`
   
   Ensure:
   - Directory `docs/` is created if it doesn't exist
   - File is substantial (>10KB for comprehensive coverage)
   - All sections are present
   - Examples are relevant to the specific resource
   - Comparisons are accurate

5) **Validation**
   
   - File exists at correct path
   - File size is substantial (>10KB)
   - Contains all required sections
   - Examples are specific to this resource (not generic)
   - Document quality matches reference examples like GcpCertManagerCert

SUCCESS CRITERIA
- v1/docs/README.md exists
- File size > 10KB (indicating comprehensive coverage)
- Contains landscape analysis section
- Contains best practices section
- Contains Project Planton's approach explanation
- Document explains 80/20 scoping decisions
- Examples are specific and actionable

OUTPUT
- Confirm file created at correct path
- Show file size
- List main sections included
- Highlight key insights captured

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE
See `~/scm/github.com/plantonhq/project-planton/apis/org/project_planton/provider/gcp/gcpcertmanagercert/v1/docs/README.md` for a gold-standard example.

NOTES
- This is the most substantial documentation piece
- Requires significant LLM effort (not a deterministic tool)
- Should be informed by the component's purpose and provider
- Quality is more important than speed
- This document justifies the API design to users
- Platform engineers will read this to understand design decisions
- This is NOT user-facing getting-started docs (that's v1/README.md)
- This is the deep technical research that backs up the component
