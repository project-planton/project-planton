# Generate Pull Request Title and Description (Ask Mode)

## Intent
- Provide a well-structured PR title and PR description based on the working changes, without modifying the repository.

## Usage
- Manual rule: invoke explicitly via `@generate-pr-title-and-description` in Chat.
- Ask mode only: do not edit files, create commits, run commands, or apply changes.

## How to Work
- Inspect the working tree, staged changes, and diff to understand the scope and impact.
- Choose a Conventional Commits type for the title:
  - feat, fix, perf, refactor, docs, test, build, ci, chore, style, revert
  - Prefer the most impactful type when multiple apply (priority: feat > fix > perf > refactor > docs > test > build > ci > chore > style > revert).
  - Add `!` for breaking changes (e.g., `feat!:`). Optionally include a scope: `type(scope): summary`.
- Title rules:
  - Imperative mood, present tense; ≤ 72 characters; no trailing period.
- Description rules:
  - Markdown format with concise, scannable sections. Include only sections that apply.

## Strict Output Format (no extra text)
- Output exactly two fenced code blocks and nothing else:
  1) PR Title as a single line in a `text` code block.
  2) PR Description in a `markdown` code block.

### Block 1 — PR Title
```text
<type>(<optional-scope>): <concise, imperative summary>
```

### Block 2 — PR Description (Markdown)
```markdown
