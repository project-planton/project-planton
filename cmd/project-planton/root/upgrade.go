var Upgrade = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "upgrade [VERSION]",
	Short: "upgrade the project-planton CLI to the latest or specified version",
	Long: `Upgrade the project-planton CLI to the latest available version, or to a specific version if provided.

On macOS, if project-planton was installed via Homebrew, this command uses 'brew upgrade --cask'.
On all other platforms (or if Homebrew is not available), it downloads the latest
binary directly from GitHub releases.

When a specific VERSION is provided, the CLI is downloaded directly from GitHub releases,
bypassing Homebrew. If Homebrew manages the current installation, you will be
prompted to uninstall via Homebrew first to avoid conflicts.

Arguments:
  VERSION   Optional. Specific version to install (e.g., v0.3.10-cli.20260110.0).
            If omitted, upgrades to the latest version.

Examples:
  # Upgrade to the latest version
  project-planton upgrade

  # Upgrade to a specific version
  project-planton upgrade v0.3.10-cli.20260110.0

  # Check for updates without installing
  project-planton upgrade --check

  # Force upgrade even if already on latest version
  project-planton upgrade --force

  # Force install a specific version
  project-planton upgrade v0.3.10-cli.20260110.0 --force`,
