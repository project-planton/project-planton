#!/usr/bin/env bash
# =============================================================================
# Publish a release artifact under its tag exactly once, and say which bytes
# the tag holds.
#
# A tag names exactly one set of bytes for every artifact under it, forever:
# platforms that deploy a module record "this resource ran release vX.Y.Z" and
# trust the tag to mean those exact bytes, so an artifact that changed under
# its tag would let a resource read as unchanged while different code is what
# deploys. The first write under a key wins; a later write to the same key --
# a rerun of a failed lane, or a release re-dispatched by hand for an old tag --
# keeps what is already published and says so, which keeps reruns working
# without ever replacing a published artifact.
#
# Every upload records the bytes' sha256 as the object's metadata, and the
# script prints the sha256 of the bytes the key holds on stdout -- the uploaded
# file's, or the kept object's. Callers that describe a release (the module
# manifest) record that value, so what they describe is always what is
# published, even when a rerun rebuilt different bytes; a rebuild that differs
# from the kept object is reported as a warning, because the published bytes
# stand. Everything else the script says goes to stderr.
#
# Usage:
#   publish_once.sh <local-file> <object-key> [extra `aws s3 cp` arguments...]
#
# Reads R2_BUCKET and AWS_ENDPOINT_URL from the environment, like the
# workflows' own aws calls. Exits non-zero only when an upload fails.
