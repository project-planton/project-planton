# Forge Workflow: Automated Proto Generation, Build & Test Validation

**Date**: November 5, 2025  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Components**: Forge Workflow, Developer Experience, Build Automation, Quality Gates

## Summary

Enhanced the forge workflow with automated validation steps that ensure proto stubs are generated, code compiles, and tests pass at critical points during resource creation. Added four new rules (016-019) that automate previously manual steps (`make protos`, `make build`, `make test`) and ensure cloud resources are properly registered in the `cloud_resource_kind.proto` enum.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The previous forge workflow had several manual steps and gaps that could lead to errors:

### Pain Points

- **Missing Proto Stub Generation**: After authoring proto files, developers had to remember to run `make protos` manually to generate Go/Java/TypeScript stubs. Forgetting this step caused compilation errors later.

- **No Build Validation**: After creating Pulumi modules, there was no automated check to ensure the Go code compiled. Developers could complete multiple forge steps before discovering compilation errors.

- **Test Failures Discovered Late**: Unit tests created by rule 003 were not automatically executed, so test failures might not be discovered until much later in development.

- **Manual Enum Registration**: After forging a new cloud resource, developers had to manually add it to `cloud_resource_kind.proto` enum, a step that was easy to forget and error-prone.

- **Compound Errors**: Issues in proto files, code, or tests would compound, making it harder to identify the root cause when discovered late.

- **Inconsistent Workflow**: Different developers might run validation steps at different times or skip them entirely.

## Solution / What's New

The forge workflow now includes four new validation rules that automate critical checkpoints:

### Rule 016: Cloud Resource Kind Registration

**Purpose**: Automatically register new cloud resources in the `cloud_resource_kind.proto` enum.

**What It Does**:
- Identifies the provider and kind name from the resource being forged
- Determines the correct enum value based on provider-specific ranges (AWS: 200-399, GCP: 600-799, etc.)
- Generates an appropriate `id_prefix` following naming conventions
- Inserts the enum entry in numerical order with proper metadata
- Validates uniqueness of both enum values and ID prefixes

**Example**:
```proto
GcpCertManagerCert = 619 [(kind_meta) = {
  provider: gcp
  version: v1
  id_prefix: "gcpcert"
}];
```

### Rule 017: Generate Proto Stubs (make protos)

**Purpose**: Validate proto files and generate language-specific stubs.

**When**: After all proto files are created (rules 001-006, 016)

**What It Does**:
- Verifies all required proto files exist (api.proto, spec.proto, stack_input.proto, stack_outputs.proto)
- Runs `make protos` from project root
- Validates proto compilation succeeds
- Confirms `.pb.go` files are generated
- Reports detailed errors with fix suggestions

**Catches**:
- Invalid proto syntax
- Missing imports
- Duplicate field numbers
- Circular dependencies
- Import resolution failures

### Rule 018: Build Validation (make build)

**Purpose**: Ensure all Go code compiles successfully.

**When**: After Pulumi module creation (rules 009-010)

**What It Does**:
- Verifies proto stubs and Pulumi module files exist
- Runs `make build` from project root
- Categorizes compilation errors by type
- Provides specific fix suggestions
- Reports which files have errors

**Catches**:
- Missing imports
- Type mismatches
- Undefined symbols
- Interface compliance issues
- Import path errors
- Nil pointer dereferences

### Rule 019: Test Validation (make test)

**Purpose**: Execute all unit tests and ensure they pass.

**When**: After test creation (rule 003) and build validation (rule 018)

**What It Does**:
- Verifies test files exist and code compiles
- Runs `make test` from project root
- Parses test output to show pass/fail statistics
- Identifies which tests failed with detailed error messages
- Provides debugging tips and fix suggestions
- Shows test coverage if available

**Catches**:
- Assertion failures
- Nil pointer errors
- Missing test dependencies
- Test timeouts
- Type mismatches in tests
- Validation rule mismatches

### Provider-Specific Ranges

Rule 016 documents the following provider ranges for cloud resource kinds:

| Provider | Range | ID Prefix Pattern | Example |
|----------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| Test/dev | 1-49 | `tcr*` | tcr1, tcr2 |
| SaaS | 50-199 | varies | conkaf, mdbatl |
| AWS | 200-399 | `aws*`, 3-char | awsvpc, ecr, s3bkt |
| Azure | 400-599 | `az*` | aks, azdns, azkv |
| GCP | 600-799 | `gcp*` | gcpdns, gcpsql, gcpcert |
| Kubernetes | 800-999 | `*k8s` | k8sms, pgk8s, cmk8s |
| DigitalOcean | 1200-1499 | `do*` | doapp, dodns, docert |

| Cloudflare | 1800-2099 | `cf*` | cfdns, cfkvn, cfr2b |

### Error Handling & Diagnostics

Each rule provides comprehensive error handling:

**Rule 017 (Proto Stubs)**:
```
❌ Error: Exit code 1

Error details:
  File: spec.proto:15
  Error: field number 3 is already used
  
Suggested fix:
  Ensure all field numbers are unique within message.
  Check fields in message GcpCertManagerCertSpec.
  Consider using field number 4 instead.
```

**Rule 018 (Build)**:
```
❌ Error: Exit code 1

Compilation failed with 2 errors:

1. File: iac/pulumi/module/cert_manager_cert.go:45
   Error: undefined: gcpcertv1.CertificateType_CERTIFICATE_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED
   
   Suggested fix:
   The enum value name may be incorrect. Check the generated spec.pb.go
   for the correct enum value name.

2. File: iac/pulumi/module/main.go:28
   Error: cannot use string as type pulumi.StringInput
   
   Suggested fix:
   Wrap the string value with pulumi.String()
```

**Rule 019 (Tests)**:
```
❌ Tests failed: 2/156 (98.7% pass rate)

Failed tests:

1. TestGcpCertManagerCertSpec_Validation/missing_gcp_project_id
   File: spec_test.go:88
   
   Error: assertion failed: expected true, got false
   
   Suggested fix:
   Check that spec.proto has [(buf.validate.field).required = true]
   on gcp_project_id. Then run: make protos
```

### Output Format

Each rule provides clear, structured output:

**Success Format**:
```
✅ Prerequisites verified
   - api.proto exists
   - spec.proto exists
   - stack_input.proto exists
   - stack_outputs.proto exists

🔨 Running: make protos

⏱️  Duration: 45 seconds

✅ Success: Exit code 0

📁 Generated files:
   - apis/.../api.pb.go
   - apis/.../spec.pb.go
   - apis/.../stack_input.pb.go
   - apis/.../stack_outputs.proto

✅ Proto stub generation complete
```

## Real-World Application: GcpCertManagerCert

- **Go Code**: 100% (compilation, types, imports, interfaces)
- **Unit Tests**: 100% (execution, assertions, coverage)
- **Enum Registry**: 100% (uniqueness, ranges, naming conventions)

## Breaking Changes

None. These are additive enhancements to the forge workflow. Existing rules (001-015) remain unchanged and fully compatible.

## Migration Guide

For developers currently using the forge workflow:

### No Action Required

The new rules integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow. You can:
- Continue using rules 001-015 as before
- Adopt new rules 016-019 for validation
- Run them manually via `@rule-number` references
- Let Cursor execute them automatically when appropriate

### Recommended Adoption

For new resources being forged:

1. **After Proto Authoring** (rules 001-006):
   ```
   @016-cloud-resource-kind  # Register in enum
   @017-generate-proto-stubs  # Generate stubs
   ```

2. **After Test Creation** (rule 003):
   ```
   @019-test-validation  # Run tests
   ```

3. **After Pulumi Module** (rules 009-010):
   ```
   @018-build-validation  # Compile code
   ```

## Design Decisions

### Why Three Separate Validation Rules?

**Considered Alternatives**:

1. **Single Validation Rule** (All-in-one):
   - ✅ Fewer rules to remember
   - ❌ Harder to debug failures
   - ❌ Can't run specific validations
   - ❌ Less clear which step failed

2. **Validation Per File Type** (Proto, Go, Test):
   - ✅ Aligns with file types
   - ❌ Doesn't match workflow sequence
   - ❌ Wrong granularity for developer actions

3. **Validation at Key Checkpoints** (Chosen):
   - ✅ Matches natural workflow breaks
   - ✅ Clear what each validation checks
   - ✅ Can run independently
   - ✅ Specific error scoping
   - ❌ More rules (acceptable trade-off)

**Rationale**: Separating validations by checkpoint aligns with the developer's mental model of the forge process and makes debugging more efficient.

### Why Run from Project Root?

All validation commands (`make protos`, `make build`, `make test`) must run from the project root because:

- Makefile is at project root
- Commands affect entire monorepo
- Dependencies span multiple packages
- Proto generation requires workspace context
- Build includes all related packages

Running from subdirectories would:
- Fail to find Makefile
- Miss cross-package dependencies
- Generate incomplete stubs
- Produce incorrect build results

### Why Detailed Error Messages?

The rules provide extensive error context and fix suggestions because:

**From Experience**:
- Most forge errors follow common patterns
- Developers often encounter same issues
- Context-specific fixes save time
- Learning embedded in error messages

**Example Value**:
```
Bad:  Error: compilation failed
Good: Error: cannot use string as pulumi.StringInput
      Fix: Wrap with pulumi.String()
```

The detailed approach reduces support requests and accelerates debugging.

### Why Not Integrate into Existing Rules?

**Considered**: Adding validation to rules 002, 006, 010

**Decision**: Separate rules because:
- ✅ Clearer separation of concerns
- ✅ Can be run independently
- ✅ Don't pollute generation rules
- ✅ Easier to skip if needed
- ✅ Better for troubleshooting

Generation and validation are distinct responsibilities that benefit from separate rules.

## Known Limitations

1. **Build Time**: `make build` can take 1-3 minutes on large codebases. This is inherent to Go compilation and can't be optimized at the rule level.

2. **Monorepo Scope**: All validation commands affect the entire monorepo, not just the new resource. This can expose unrelated issues but ensures global consistency.

3. **No Partial Validation**: Cannot run `make protos` for only the new resource. This is a Makefile limitation.

4. **Test Isolation**: `make test` runs all tests, not just new ones. While slower, it ensures no regressions.

5. **Error Output Truncation**: Very long error outputs may be truncated in the rule output. Full logs are always in terminal.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Incremental Validation**: Run only tests/builds related to changed files
2. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent validations concurrently
3. **Caching**: Cache proto stubs and build artifacts for faster validation
4. **Custom Test Suites**: Run only spec tests during forge, full suite separately
5. **Progress Indicators**: Live progress bars for long-running validations
6. **Auto-Fix Suggestions**: AI-powered fix recommendations for common errors
7. **Validation Profiles**: Quick/thorough validation modes
8. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Integrate validation into git workflow

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Verification

Each new rule was tested during the `GcpCertManagerCert` resource creation:

**Rule 016**:
```bash
# Verified enum entry added correctly
grep -A 4 "GcpCertManagerCert" \
  apis/project/planton/shared/cloudresourcekind/cloud_resource_kind.proto
# Result: Correct enum value, id_prefix, and metadata
```

**Rule 017**:
```bash
# Verified proto stubs generated
ls apis/project/planton/provider/gcp/gcpcertmanagercert/v1/*.pb.go
# Result: 4 files generated successfully
```

**Rule 018**:
```bash
# Verified build succeeds
cd ~/scm/github.com/plantonhq/project-planton
make build
# Result: Exit code 0, no compilation errors
```

**Rule 019**:
```bash
# Verified tests pass
make test
# Result: All 9 tests passed
```

### Integration Testing

The complete workflow (rules 001-019) was executed to create `GcpCertManagerCert`:

- ✅ All proto files created successfully
- ✅ Enum registered in cloud_resource_kind.proto
- ✅ Proto stubs generated without errors
- ✅ Go code compiled successfully
- ✅ All unit tests passed
- ✅ No linter errors

### Error Scenario Testing

Intentionally introduced errors to test error handling:

**Invalid Proto Syntax**:
- ✅ Rule 017 caught syntax error
- ✅ Error message showed line number
- ✅ Suggested fix was accurate

**Type Mismatch in Go**:
- ✅ Rule 018 caught type error
- ✅ Error showed file and line
- ✅ Fix suggestion worked

**Failing Test Assertion**:
- ✅ Rule 019 caught test failure
- ✅ Error showed which test failed
- ✅ Debugging tips were helpful
