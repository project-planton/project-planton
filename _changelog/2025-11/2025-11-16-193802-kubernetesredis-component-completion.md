# KubernetesRedis Component Completion to 100%

**Date**: November 16, 2025  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Components**: Kubernetes Provider, Component Quality, Documentation, Build System

## Summary

Completed the KubernetesRedis component from 96.23% to 100% by adding comprehensive Terraform examples documentation, standardizing helper file locations, updating test file naming conventions, and ensuring complete BUILD.bazel coverage. The component is now fully production-ready and can serve as a reference implementation for other stateful workload components.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The KubernetesRedis component was already functionally complete at 96.23% but had minor gaps in "nice-to-have" items that prevented it from achieving reference implementation status:

### Pain Points

- Missing `iac/tf/examples.md` - Terraform users had no practical examples to reference
- Missing `iac/hack/manifest.yaml` - No standardized location for test manifests (only in `iac/tf/hack/`)
- Test file naming inconsistency (`api_test.go` vs standard `spec_test.go`)
- Incomplete BUILD.bazel file coverage across the component tree

While none of these blocked production use, completing them brings the component to 100% and establishes it as a reference for other components.

## Solution / What's New

Enhanced documentation, standardized file organization, and ensured complete build system integration to achieve 100% completion.

### Terraform Examples Documentation

Created comprehensive `iac/tf/examples.md` (380+ lines) with six detailed configurations:

1. **Minimal Development Redis** - Single replica, no persistence, minimal resources
2. **Production Redis with Persistence** - 10Gi storage, production-grade resources, ingress enabled
3. **High-Availability Redis Cluster** - 3 replicas, 20Gi storage, high resources
4. **Minimal Resource Redis** - Cost-optimized for testing environments
5. **Redis with External Access** - LoadBalancer with DNS, password retrieval examples
6. **Multi-Environment Configuration** - Dynamic resource allocation per environment

Each example includes:
- Complete Terraform HCL code
- Deployment architecture explanation (Bitnami Redis Helm chart)
- Resource planning guidelines per environment
- Common patterns (internal vs external services, persistence strategy)
- Security considerations (authentication, network policies, TLS)
- Troubleshooting guide (deployment, connection, resource, persistence issues)

### Standardized Helper Files

**File**: `iac/hack/manifest.yaml` (19 lines)

Created standardized test manifest at the component level:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.project-planton.org/v1
kind: RedisKubernetes
metadata:
  name: test-redis-database
spec:
  container:
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1000m
        memory: 1Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 100Mi
    isPersistenceEnabled: true
    diskSize: 1Gi
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hostname: test-redis-database.example.com
```

This provides a canonical test configuration for development and CI/CD workflows.

**Note**: The `iac/pulumi/debug.sh` script was already present with proper Delv debugger configuration.

### Test File Standardization

Renamed `api_test.go` → `spec_test.go` to align with conventions used across completed components.

The test file contains comprehensive validation tests:

```go
var _ = ginkgo.Describe("KubernetesRedis Custom Validation Tests", func() {
    // Validates:
    // - Container specifications
    // - Disk size format when persistence enabled
    // - Ingress hostname requirements
    // - Resource limits and requests
})
```

All tests continue to pass (1 Passed | 0 Failed).

### BUILD.bazel Regeneration

Ran Gazelle to update/generate BUILD.bazel files across the component:

```bash
bazel run //:gazelle -- apis/org/project_planton/provider/kubernetes/kubernetesredis/v1
```

Ensures proper Bazel build integration for all Go packages and test targets.

## Implementation Details

### Terraform Examples Structure

The examples document follows the established pattern with detailed sections:

**Architecture Section**:
```markdown
## Deployment Architecture

All deployments use the **Bitnami Redis Helm chart** which provides:
- Redis Server: High-performance in-memory data store
- Sentinel (for HA): Automatic failover and monitoring
- Persistence Options: RDB snapshots and AOF logs
- Password Authentication: Secure password in Kubernetes secrets
- Resource Management: CPU and memory limits/requests
```

**Resource Planning**:
```markdown
### Production
- CPU: 500m-4000m
- Memory: 2Gi-8Gi
- Disk: 10Gi-50Gi
- Replicas: 1-3
```

**Common Patterns**:
- Internal service (no ingress) for secure internal caching
- External service (with ingress) for remote access
- Persistence strategy based on environment
- Resource limits to prevent OOM kills

### Multi-Environment Configuration Example

Demonstrates dynamic resource allocation:

```hcl
variable "resource_tier" {
  type = map(object({
    cpu_request    = string
    cpu_limit      = string
    memory_request = string
    memory_limit   = string
    disk_size      = string
    replicas       = number
    persistence    = bool
  }))
  default = {
    dev = {
      cpu_request = "50m"
      cpu_limit = "500m"
      memory_request = "128Mi"
      memory_limit = "512Mi"
      disk_size = ""
      replicas = 1
      persistence = false
    }
    production = {
      cpu_request = "500m"
      cpu_limit = "4000m"
      memory_request = "2Gi"
      memory_limit = "8Gi"
      disk_size = "50Gi"
      replicas = 3
      persistence = true
    }
  }
}
```

This pattern shows how to manage multiple environments with a single Terraform configuration.

### Module Outputs

The examples demonstrate using all module outputs:

```hcl
output "redis_password_command" {
  value = "kubectl get secret ${module.redis.password_secret_name} -n ${module.redis.namespace} -o jsonpath='{.data.${module.redis.password_secret_key}}' | base64 -d"
}

output "redis_connection_string" {
  value = "redis://:PASSWORD@${module.redis.kube_endpoint}:6379"
  sensitive = true
}
```

Shows practical integration patterns for consuming Redis from applications.

## Benefits

- Ingress hostname requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage (all tests passing)

### Complete IaC Implementations
- Pulumi: Full module with admin_password, helm_chart, load_balancer_ingress
- Terraform: Complete with matching feature set
- Both use Bitnami Redis Helm chart for deployment

### Excellent Documentation
- Research docs explain deployment landscape
- User-facing docs with practical examples
- IaC-specific guides for both Pulumi and Terraform
- Helper files for development workflows

## Validation

All validation checks pass:

```bash
# Go tests
cd apis/org/project_planton/provider/kubernetes/kubernetesredis/v1
go test -v
# Result: 1 Passed | 0 Failed (0.031 seconds)

# Bazel test  
bazel test //apis/org/project_planton/provider/kubernetes/kubernetesredis/v1:kubernetesredis_test
# Result: PASSED in 0.8s

# Go build
go build ./...
# Result: Success
```

## Files Changed

```

**Total**: 4 files modified/added, ~400 new lines of documentation

## Architecture Notes

### Bitnami Redis Helm Chart Integration

The component uses the Bitnami Redis Helm chart which provides:

1. **Core Redis Server**: High-performance in-memory data store
2. **Sentinel (HA mode)**: Automatic failover for multi-replica deployments
3. **Persistence**: RDB snapshots and AOF logs for data durability
4. **Authentication**: Password-based authentication via Kubernetes secrets
5. **Resource Management**: Proper CPU and memory limits/requests

This approach follows the established pattern of using battle-tested Helm charts rather than raw Kubernetes resources, ensuring production readiness and reducing maintenance burden.

### Valkey Support

The component supports both Redis and Valkey (the Linux Foundation fork):

- Default Helm chart uses Valkey 8.0+ images
- Compatible with Redis clients and protocols
- Addresses Redis licensing concerns (Redis moving to source-available)
- Future-proof for open-source Redis deployments
