# Comprehensive Documentation Expansion for Project Planton

**Date**: November 11, 2025  
**Type**: Feature  
**Components**: Documentation System, CLI Reference, User Guides, Technical Documentation, Website

## Summary

Expanded Project Planton documentation from 6 pages to 20+ comprehensive guides, creating a complete documentation system that covers CLI commands (Pulumi and OpenTofu), manifest structure, credential management, kustomize integration, advanced usage patterns, and troubleshooting. The documentation follows a dual-format approach with engaging user-facing guides on the website and concise technical references in code directories, making Project Planton accessible to developers at all skill levels while maintaining thorough technical documentation for contributors.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

Project Planton had minimal documentation coverage. While the main README provided an excellent philosophical overview, critical operational documentation was missing or inaccessible:

### Pain Points

- **Pulumi commands documented but hidden**: Excellent Pulumi commands reference existed in `cmd/project-planton/root/pulumi/README.md` but wasn't accessible via the website—users had to browse the code repository to find it
- **No OpenTofu/Terraform documentation**: Despite full OpenTofu support, there was zero user-facing documentation for `tofu` commands
- **No manifest guide**: Users had to infer manifest structure from examples without understanding KRM patterns, validation, or defaults
- **No credential guide**: Setting up cloud provider authentication was tribal knowledge—no comprehensive guide across all 10+ providers
- **Kustomize undocumented**: Multi-environment deployment patterns using kustomize were not explained
- **Advanced features undiscovered**: Powerful features like `--set` overrides, URL manifests, and module customization were not documented
- **No troubleshooting guide**: Common errors and solutions were not centralized, users had to search GitHub issues
- **Fragmented navigation**: No clear learning path or documentation organization

## Solution / What's New

Implemented a comprehensive documentation system with three strategic layers:

### 1. User-Facing Guides (Website)

Created engaging, example-rich documentation accessible at `https://project-planton.org/docs/`:

**CLI Reference Section** (`/docs/cli/`):
- Complete CLI command reference
- Pulumi commands comprehensive guide (surfaced from code)
- OpenTofu commands comprehensive guide (newly created)
- Section index with learning paths

**Guides Section** (`/docs/guides/`):
- Manifest structure and KRM patterns
- Credentials management for all providers
- Kustomize integration for multi-environment deployments
- Advanced usage techniques
- Section index with progressive learning path

**Troubleshooting** (`/docs/troubleshooting`):
- Organized by symptom (not by technology)
- Provider-specific authentication issues
- Pulumi and OpenTofu state management problems
- Quick solutions with copy-paste commands

### 2. Technical References (Code Directories)

Created concise technical documentation for developers:

**Command Documentation**:
- `cmd/project-planton/root/tofu/README.md` - OpenTofu command implementation reference
- `cmd/project-planton/README.md` - CLI architecture and development guide

**Package Documentation**:
- `internal/manifest/README.md` - Manifest loading, validation, and manipulation
- `pkg/kustomize/builder/README.md` - Kustomize builder implementation

### 3. Documentation Integration

- Updated main docs index with clear navigation
- Created section indexes for discoverability
- Cross-referenced all documents
- Added frontmatter for website integration

### Writing Approach

All documentation followed the user's specifications:

**User-Facing Documentation**:
- Engaging, conversational tone with appropriate analogies
- Real-world examples (not foo/bar)
- Progressive disclosure (simple → advanced)
- Troubleshooting sections
- Cross-references to related docs
- Timeless writing (no "this update" references)

**Technical Documentation**:
- Concise, focused on "how" and "why"
- API documentation style
- Code examples showing actual usage
- Architecture diagrams
- Links to user-facing guides

**Analogies Used**:
- Restaurant menu/order form (manifests)
- Keys to different buildings (credentials)
- Clothing store/sizes (kustomize base and overlays)
- Version control system (Pulumi for infrastructure)
- Blueprint compiler (OpenTofu)
- Recipe cards (manifests)

**Exclusions**:
- Correctly excluded `stack_input` references from user-facing docs (internal SaaS platform bridge)
- No speculation—all content grounded in actual code implementation

## Technical Decisions

### Why Dual Documentation Format?

**User-Facing (Website)**:
- Engaging tone, analogies, progressive learning
- Comprehensive with workflows and examples
- Accessible without cloning repository
- SEO-friendly

**Technical (Code)**:
- Concise, developer-focused
- Implementation details and architecture
- Available when browsing code
- Links to comprehensive website version

**Benefits**: Developers browsing code get quick reference + link to full guide. Users get polished, comprehensive documentation.

### Why Surface Pulumi Commands to Website?

The existing Pulumi documentation was excellent but invisible to users. Copying to website with minimal adaptation (frontmatter, link adjustments) makes it discoverable while maintaining quality.

### Why Comprehensive OpenTofu Documentation?

Project Planton supports both Pulumi and OpenTofu equally. Having comprehensive docs only for Pulumi would signal second-class OpenTofu support. Created parallel documentation structure to show both are first-class citizens.

### Why Separate Troubleshooting Guide?

**Alternative considered**: Embed troubleshooting in each guide.  
**Chosen approach**: Centralized troubleshooting.

**Rationale**:
- Users in pain don't know which guide to check
- Symptoms often span multiple topics (auth + state + manifest)
- Centralized page is searchable
- Can organize by symptom rather than technology

### Why Analogies Throughout?

Following the existing README's style (restaurant analogy), analogies make complex technical concepts accessible:
- Restaurant menu = manifest structure
- Keys to buildings = credentials
- Clothing sizes = kustomize overlays
- Version control = Pulumi
- Blueprint compiler = OpenTofu

Makes documentation enjoyable to read while maintaining technical accuracy.
