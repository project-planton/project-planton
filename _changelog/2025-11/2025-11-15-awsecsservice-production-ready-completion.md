# AwsEcsService: Production-Ready Completion with Auto Scaling and Health Check Grace Period

**Date:** November 15, 2025  
**Component:** AwsEcsService  
**Type:** Enhancement  
**Impact:** High - Completes production-ready feature set based on 80/20 research analysis

## Summary

Completed the `AwsEcsService` component implementation by adding two critical production features that were identified in the research document but missing from the spec: **Auto Scaling** and **Health Check Grace Period**. These features are essential for production deployments and were part of the original 80/20 analysis.

## Background

While the previous audit report showed 100% completion, it only verified file existence, not whether the implementation matched the spec. A detailed review of the research document revealed two critical features from the 80/20 analysis that were not implemented:

1. **Health Check Grace Period** - Essential for preventing deployment failures during container boot
2. **Auto Scaling** - Core production feature for automatic capacity management

## Changes

### 1. Spec Changes (`spec.proto`)

#### Health Check Grace Period
Added `health_check_grace_period_seconds` field to the main `AwsEcsServiceSpec`:
- Optional field with default value of 60 seconds
- Prevents ECS from prematurely killing tasks during startup
- Critical for applications with slow boot times (Spring Boot, JVM apps, etc.)

#### Auto Scaling Configuration
Added `AwsEcsServiceAutoscaling` message with target tracking configuration:
- `enabled`: Boolean to enable/disable autoscaling
- `min_tasks`: Minimum task count (≥1)
- `max_tasks`: Maximum task count (≥1)
- `target_cpu_percent`: Target CPU utilization (1-100%, default 75%)
- `target_memory_percent`: Optional target memory utilization (1-100%)

### 2. Pulumi Implementation

#### Health Check Grace Period Support
- Added `HealthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` field to ECS service configuration
- Automatically set when ALB is enabled
- Defaults to 60 seconds, configurable via spec

#### Auto Scaling Implementation
Created comprehensive autoscaling support:
- **Scalable Target**: Configures min/max capacity for the ECS service
- **CPU-based Scaling**: Target tracking policy for CPU utilization
- **Memory-based Scaling**: Optional target tracking policy for memory utilization
- **Proper Dependencies**: Ensures autoscaling resources are created after service
- **Cluster Name Extraction**: Properly extracts cluster name from ARN for resource ID
- **Cooldown Periods**: 300s scale-in, 60s scale-out (production-ready defaults)

### 3. Terraform Implementation

#### Health Check Grace Period Support
- Added `health_check_grace_period_seconds` to ECS service resource
- Only set when ALB is enabled
- Default value of 60 seconds

#### Auto Scaling Implementation
- **Scalable Target**: `aws_appautoscaling_target` resource
- **CPU Scaling Policy**: `aws_appautoscaling_policy` for CPU utilization
- **Memory Scaling Policy**: Optional policy for memory utilization
- **Lifecycle Management**: Ignores desired_count changes when autoscaling is enabled
- **Local Variables**: Added comprehensive locals for autoscaling configuration

### 4. Testing

Added comprehensive test coverage in `spec_test.go`:
- **Autoscaling Validations**:
  - Valid autoscaling configuration passes
  - Min tasks < 1 fails
  - Max tasks < 1 fails
  - Target CPU percent outside 1-100 range fails
  - Target memory percent outside 1-100 range fails
- **Health Check Grace Period Validations**:
  - Valid values (60s, 120s) pass
  - Configurable grace periods work correctly

All 15 test specs pass successfully.

### 5. Documentation

#### Main `README.md`
- Added "Auto Scaling" section describing target tracking capabilities
- Added "Health Check Grace Period" section explaining slow-start app support
- Updated benefits to highlight automatic scaling and production-ready defaults
- Updated example to show production-ready configuration

#### `examples.md`
- Added "Example with Autoscaling" showing CPU and memory-based scaling
- Added "Example with Health Check Grace Period" for slow-start applications
- Added comprehensive "Complete Production Example" combining all features

#### Pulumi `examples.md`
- Added autoscaling example with target tracking
- Added health check grace period example for JVM applications
- Added complete production example showcasing all features

## Technical Details

### Health Check Grace Period
From the research document:
> Set `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds` (e.g., 60-120 seconds) to instruct ECS to ignore ALB health status during initial boot.

This prevents the race condition where:
1. ECS starts a task, container becomes RUNNING
2. Application is still booting (30-60s for Spring Boot)
3. ALB health check fails
4. ECS kills the task → deployment fails

### Auto Scaling
From the research document:
> Expose a simple `autoscaling` block accepting `min_tasks`, `max_tasks`, `target_cpu_percent`, and optionally `target_memory_percent`.

Implementation uses AWS Application Auto Scaling with:
- **Target Tracking**: Automatically maintains target CPU/memory utilization
- **Aggressive Scale-Out**: 60s cooldown for quick response to load increases
- **Conservative Scale-In**: 300s cooldown to prevent thrashing
- **Dual Metrics**: Support for both CPU and memory-based scaling

## Impact

### Before
- Service deployments could fail during boot due to premature health check failures
- Manual capacity management required for production workloads
- Missing critical features identified in 80/20 research analysis

### After
- ✅ Automatic capacity management based on utilization metrics
- ✅ Deployment failures prevented with configurable grace periods
- ✅ Complete implementation of all 80/20 essential and common features
- ✅ Production-ready out of the box

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments
No breaking changes. New fields are optional:
- `health_check_grace_period_seconds` defaults to 60 seconds when ALB is enabled
- `autoscaling` is opt-in via `enabled: true`

### Recommended Configuration
For production services, add:

```yaml
spec:
  # ... existing configuration ...
  healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds: 90  # Adjust based on your app's boot time
  autoscaling:
    enabled: true
    minTasks: 2
    maxTasks: 10
    targetCpuPercent: 75  # Default: 75%
```

## Files Changed

2. ✅ **Common Fields (19%)**: All implemented, including autoscaling and health check grace period
3. ⏭️ **Advanced Fields (1%)**: Reserved for future needs (capacity providers, service discovery, blue/green deployments)
