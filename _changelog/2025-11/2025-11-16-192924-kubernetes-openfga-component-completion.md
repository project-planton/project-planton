# KubernetesOpenFga Component Completion to 100%

**Date**: November 16, 2025
**Type**: Enhancement
**Components**: Kubernetes Provider, Component Infrastructure, Testing Framework, Documentation

## Summary

Completed the KubernetesOpenFga deployment component from 99.17% to 100% by addressing the final quick wins identified in the audit. This work standardized the test file naming, added comprehensive Terraform usage examples, and created a shared test manifest location for consistency across IaC implementations. The component is now production-ready with full documentation coverage and follows all Project Planton conventions.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

The KubernetesOpenFga component was already in excellent shape at 99.17% completion but had three minor gaps preventing 100% status:

### Pain Points

- **Missing Terraform Examples**: While Pulumi had comprehensive examples (`iac/pulumi/examples.md`), Terraform users lacked equivalent documentation, creating an inconsistency in IaC tool support
- **Non-Standard Test Naming**: The validation test file was named `api_test.go` instead of the conventional `spec_test.go`, deviating from the standard pattern used across other components
- **Fragmented Test Manifests**: Test manifests only existed under `iac/tf/hack/manifest.yaml` without a shared location at `iac/hack/manifest.yaml`, missing the expected convention for cross-tool test fixtures

These gaps, while minor, prevented the component from achieving the ideal state defined in Project Planton's component architecture standards.

## Solution / What's New

Implemented the three quick wins to achieve 100% completion:

### 1. Comprehensive Terraform Examples (381 lines)

Created `iac/tf/examples.md` with six complete, copy-paste ready Terraform usage examples:

- **Basic Deployment with PostgreSQL**: Minimal configuration for getting started
- **Deployment with Ingress Enabled**: External access configuration with hostname
- **Deployment with MySQL Datastore**: Alternative datastore engine example
- **High Availability Production**: 5 replicas with autoscaling and production resources
- **Development Environment**: Minimal resources for local testing
- **Staging with Custom Helm Values**: Advanced configuration with custom settings

Each example includes:
- Complete Terraform HCL configuration
- Output value references
- Connection instructions (kubectl port-forward, external hostname)
- Best practices and deployment notes

### 2. Standardized Test File Naming

Renamed `api_test.go` to `spec_test.go` to follow Project Planton's standard naming convention:
- Test files validate spec.proto buf.validate rules
- Naming pattern `spec_test.go` is consistent across all deployment components
- No code changes - pure rename for consistency

### 3. Shared Test Manifest Location

Created `iac/hack/manifest.yaml` (21 lines) as the canonical location for test manifests:
- Provides consistent test fixture location across IaC implementations
- Contains complete OpenFGA server configuration with all required fields
- Enables both Pulumi and Terraform to reference the same test manifest

## Implementation Details

### Terraform Examples Structure

The examples document follows this pattern:

```hcl
module "openfga_basic" {
  source = "./path/to/kubernetesopenfga/v1/iac/tf"

  metadata = {
    name = "basic-openfga"
  }

  spec = {
    container = {
      replicas = 1
      resources = {
        requests = { cpu = "50m", memory = "100Mi" }
        limits = { cpu = "1000m", memory = "1Gi" }
      }
    }
    datastore = {
      engine = "postgres"
      uri    = "postgres://user:password@db-host:5432/openfga"
    }
    ingress = {
      enabled  = false
      hostname = ""
    }
  }
}
```

Each example demonstrates:
- Different resource allocation patterns (dev, staging, production)
- Both PostgreSQL and MySQL datastore configurations
- Ingress enabled/disabled scenarios
- Helm values customization options
- Output value usage

### Documentation Added

**Connection Methods Section**:
```markdown
## Connecting to OpenFGA

### From within the Kubernetes cluster:
http://<kube_endpoint>:8080

### Using kubectl port-forward:
kubectl port-forward -n <namespace> service/<service-name> 8080:8080

### Using external hostname (if ingress is enabled):
https://<external_hostname>
```

**Best Practices Section**:
- Production deployments: 3+ replicas, ingress with TLS, SSL for database
- Security: Secrets management, network policies, TLS encryption
- Performance: Resource tuning, connection pooling, autoscaling
- Development: Single replica, port-forwarding, minimal resources

### Test Manifest Configuration

The shared manifest (`iac/hack/manifest.yaml`) includes:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.project-planton.org/v1
kind: OpenFgaKubernetes
metadata:
  name: test-open-fga-server
spec:
  container:
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      limits: { cpu: 3000m, memory: 3Gi }
      requests: { cpu: 250m, memory: 250Mi }
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    hostname: test-open-fga-server.example.com
  datastore:
    engine: postgres
    uri: postgres://postgres:somepassword@database-hostname:5432/some-database-name?sslmode=disable
```

## Benefits

### For Terraform Users
- **Parity with Pulumi**: Terraform users now have the same level of documentation as Pulumi users
- **Faster Onboarding**: Six ready-to-use examples reduce time to first deployment
- **Production Guidance**: Clear patterns for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: All examples are complete and executable

### For Component Maintainers
- **Consistency**: Standard naming conventions make codebase navigation predictable
- **Shared Fixtures**: Single test manifest location reduces duplication
- **Complete Coverage**: 100% completion status indicates production readiness

### Quantitative Improvements
- **Documentation Coverage**: +381 lines of Terraform examples
- **Test Convention Compliance**: 100% (renamed test file)
- **Manifest Consolidation**: Shared location created for cross-tool testing

## Impact

### Component Status
- **Before**: 99.17% complete (Functionally Complete)
- **After**: 100% complete (Production Ready)
- **Gaps Closed**: 3 of 3 quick wins addressed

### Files Modified
```
iac/hack/manifest.yaml         (new file, 21 lines)
iac/tf/examples.md             (new file, 381 lines)
api_test.go → spec_test.go     (renamed, no code changes)
```

### Developer Experience
- Terraform users now have comprehensive examples matching Pulumi's documentation quality
- Standard naming conventions make the codebase more navigable
- Shared test manifests reduce duplication and potential inconsistencies

### Production Readiness
All validation tests pass:
```bash
=== RUN   TestKubernetesOpenFga
Running Suite: KubernetesOpenFga Suite
Will run 1 of 1 specs
•
SUCCESS! -- 1 Passed | 0 Failed | 0 Pending | 0 Skipped
PASS
```

## Related Work

### Similar Component Completions
This completion work is part of a broader effort to bring all Kubernetes deployment components to 100% status:
- KubernetesPerconaMongoOperator: Completed 90.40% → 100%
- KubernetesPerconaMysqlOperator: Completed 82.21% → 100%

- Datastore engine validation (postgres/mysql only)
- Ingress hostname requirement when ingress is enabled
- Complete valid specification passes all rules

### Test Execution
```bash
cd apis/org/project_planton/provider/kubernetes/kubernetesopenfga/v1
go test -v
# Output: 1 Passed | 0 Failed
```

### Integration Testing
Test manifest at `iac/hack/manifest.yaml` can be used for:
- Pulumi preview/up operations
- Terraform plan/apply validation
- E2E deployment verification

## Next Steps

### For Users
1. Reference `iac/tf/examples.md` for Terraform deployment patterns
2. Use `iac/hack/manifest.yaml` as a template for custom deployments
3. Deploy with confidence - component is 100% production-ready

### For Maintainers
1. Use this component as a reference example for completing other Kubernetes components
2. Apply the same quick wins pattern to components at 90%+ completion
3. Ensure all future components include both Pulumi and Terraform examples from the start
