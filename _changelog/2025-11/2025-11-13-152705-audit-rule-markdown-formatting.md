# Audit Rule Markdown Formatting Enhancement

**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Component**: Audit Rule  
**Type**: Enhancement  
**Impact**: Report Quality & Readability

---

## Summary

Enhanced the `audit-project-planton-component` rule with comprehensive markdown formatting requirements to ensure all generated audit reports render beautifully with proper tables, code blocks, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

---

## Problem Statement

Audit reports were being generated with inconsistent markdown formatting:

- **Tables missing header separators** → Didn't render as tables in markdown viewers
- **Missing blank lines around headings** → Poor readability and cluttered appearance
- **Code blocks without language identifiers** → No syntax highlighting
- **Inconsistent spacing** → Hard to scan and find information
- **Poor visual hierarchy** → Sections blended together

This made reports difficult to read and reduced their professional quality, especially when viewed in GitHub, VS Code, or other markdown renderers.

---

## Solution

Added comprehensive **markdown formatting requirements** to Step 4 (Generate Audit Report) with:

### 1. Ten Explicit Formatting Rules

1. **Headings** - Proper hierarchy (`#`, `##`, `###`, `####`) with blank lines before/after
2. **Tables** - Proper syntax with `|---|---|---|` header separator and column alignment
3. **Lists** - Use `-` for unordered, `1.` for ordered, with blank lines around them
4. **Code Blocks** - Use triple backticks with language identifier (```bash, ```go, etc.)
5. **Emphasis** - Use `**bold**` for critical items, `✅⚠️❌` for status
6. **Horizontal Rules** - Use `---` with blank lines before/after
7. **Links** - Proper `[text](url)` syntax, inline code for file paths
8. **Blockquotes** - Use `>` for important warnings/notes
9. **Spacing** - One blank line between paragraphs, sections, tables, lists, code blocks
10. **Escaping** - Proper escaping of special characters

### 2. Pre-Write Validation Checklist

Added mandatory checklist before writing report:

```
VALIDATION BEFORE WRITING:
- [ ] All tables have proper header separators
- [ ] All headings have blank lines around them
- [ ] All code blocks specify language
- [ ] All lists have blank lines around them
- [ ] Status indicators (✅⚠️❌) used consistently
- [ ] Section structure is hierarchical (##, ###, ####)
```

### 3. Enhanced Report Template with Examples

Updated the report template with proper formatting examples:

**Tables:**
```markdown
| Category | Weight | Score | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Cloud Resource Registry | 4.44% | 4.44% | ✅ |
| Protobuf API Definitions | 17.76% | 15.20% | ⚠️ |
```

**Code Blocks with Context:**
```markdown
To verify tests, run:

```bash
cd apis/org/project_planton/provider/atlas/mongodbatlas/v1/
go test -v
```

✅ **Passed:**
- Tests compile without errors
- All 15 tests pass
```

**Structured Lists:**
```markdown
1. **Missing spec_test.go**
   - **Why:** Tests validate buf.validate rules
   - **How:** Run forge rule 003
   - **File:** `spec_test.go`
```

**Blockquotes for Critical Notes:**
```markdown
> **Critical:** Tests are failing. Component cannot be marked production-ready.
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

**Audit Rule:**
- `.cursor/rules/deployment-component/audit/audit-project-planton-component.mdc`
  - Added 80+ lines of formatting requirements (before report structure)
  - Added validation checklist
  - Enhanced report template with properly formatted examples
  - Updated all section examples with correct markdown
  - Added reminder in Important Notes section

### Formatting Examples Added

Enhanced template sections to demonstrate proper formatting:

**Before:**
```
### 3. Protobuf API Definitions (17.76%)
✅ Passed:
- api.proto exists
❌ Failed:
- None
**Score:** X.XX% / 17.76%
```

**After:**
```markdown
### 3. Protobuf API Definitions (17.76%)

#### 3.1 Proto Files (13.32%)

✅ **Passed:**

- `api.proto` exists (2.5 KB)
- `spec.proto` exists (8.3 KB)
- `stack_input.proto` exists (450 bytes)
- `stack_outputs.proto` exists (1.2 KB)

❌ **Failed:**

- None

**Score:** X.XX% / 13.32%

#### 3.4 Unit Tests - Execution (2.78%)

To verify tests, run:

```bash
cd apis/org/project_planton/provider/atlas/mongodbatlas/v1/
go test -v
```

✅ **Passed:**

- Tests compile without errors
- All 15 tests pass
- Validation rules verified

> **Note:** Test execution is mandatory for production-readiness. Failing tests block completion.

**Score:** X.XX% / 2.78%

**Total Protobuf API Score:** X.XX% / 17.76%
```

---

## Impact

### Before This Enhancement

Reports had formatting issues:
- Tables didn't render (missing header separators)
- Code blocks without syntax highlighting
- Cluttered appearance with no spacing
- Hard to scan and find information

### After This Enhancement

Reports are now:
- ✅ Professional and polished
- ✅ Easy to read and scan
- ✅ Tables render perfectly
- ✅ Code blocks have syntax highlighting
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Consistent across all audits

---

## Testing

Formatting requirements have been validated:
- ✅ Tables render correctly in GitHub, VS Code, markdown viewers
- ✅ Code blocks have proper syntax highlighting
- ✅ Headings create proper document hierarchy
- ✅ Lists format correctly with proper spacing
- ✅ Blockquotes stand out visually
- ✅ Status indicators display consistently

---

## Related

This enhancement mirrors the same formatting requirements added to:
- `planton-cloud/.cursor/rules/product/apis/infra-hub/cloud-resource/audit-planton-cloud-deployment-component.mdc`

Both audit rules now follow the same markdown formatting standards for consistency across Project Planton and Planton Cloud audit reports.

---

## Next Steps

Future audit reports will automatically:
- ✅ Use proper markdown formatting
- ✅ Have consistent visual appearance
- ✅ Render beautifully in all markdown viewers
- ✅ Be professional and easy to read

No migration needed - enhancement takes effect immediately for all future audits.

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Version**: Project Planton (all versions)  
**Impact**: All future audit reports
