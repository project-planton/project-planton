# Complete Credential Management CRUD Operations

**Date**: December 11, 2025
**Type**: Feature
**Components**: CLI Commands, Backend API, Frontend UI, Credential Management, User Experience, Documentation

## Summary

Implemented complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for credential management across CLI, backend API, and frontend UI. Added three new CLI commands (`credential:get`, `credential:update`, `credential:delete`) to complement existing operations, extended backend API with corresponding RPC methods, and built a complete frontend UI for credential management. This provides full lifecycle management for cloud provider credentials across all interfaces. All components were thoroughly tested and documented.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

Previously, the credential management system only supported creating and listing credentials. Users had no way to:

- View detailed information about a specific credential
- Update existing credentials (e.g., when rotating keys or changing regions)
- Delete credentials that were no longer needed

This limitation made credential management cumbersome, especially when:

- Rotating credentials for security purposes
- Cleaning up unused or outdated credentials
- Updating credential configurations (e.g., changing AWS regions)
- Auditing credential details before deployments

### Pain Points

- No way to view full credential details after creation
- Credential rotation required manual database operations
- No mechanism to update credential configurations
- Inability to remove unused credentials
- Limited visibility into credential metadata (creation/update timestamps)

## Solution / What's New

Implemented complete CRUD operations across three layers:

### CLI Commands

Added three new CLI commands to complete the credential management lifecycle:

1. **`credential:get`** - Retrieve detailed information about a specific credential
2. **`credential:update`** - Update existing credentials (name and provider-specific data)
3. **`credential:delete`** - Delete credentials by ID

All commands follow the same patterns as existing credential commands:

- Unified interface with `--provider` flag for multi-provider support
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Security features (sensitive data masking)
- Consistent user experience

### Backend API

Extended the credential service with new RPC methods:

1. **`GetCredential`** - Retrieve credential by ID
2. **`UpdateCredential`** - Update existing credential
3. **`DeleteCredential`** - Delete credential by ID

Backend changes include:

- Updated proto definitions with new RPC methods
- Repository methods for get, update, and delete operations
- Service layer implementation with proper validation

### Frontend UI

Built complete credential management interface:

1. **Credential List View** - Display all credentials with filtering
2. **Credential Forms** - Provider-specific forms (GCP, AWS, Azure)
3. **Credential Drawer** - Create/Edit modal with tabbed interface
4. **Shared Components** - Reusable UI components for credential management

Frontend features:

- Provider-specific credential forms with validation
- Tabbed interface for different providers
- Real-time credential list updates
- Delete confirmation dialogs
- Form field components with help tooltips

### Key Features

**Credential Get Command:**

- Retrieve credential by unique ID
- Display all metadata (ID, name, provider, timestamps)
- Show credential data with automatic sensitive data masking
- Support for all providers (GCP, AWS, Azure)

**Credential Update Command:**

- Update credential name
- Update provider-specific credential data
- Validate provider type matches existing credential
- Support for all provider types with appropriate flags

**Credential Delete Command:**

- Delete credentials by ID
- Irreversible operation with clear warnings
- Proper error handling for invalid IDs

## Implementation Details

### Command Implementation

**Files Added:**

- `cmd/project-planton/root/credential_get.go` - Get command implementation
- `cmd/project-planton/root/credential_update.go` - Update command implementation
- `cmd/project-planton/root/credential_delete.go` - Delete command implementation

**Files Modified:**

- `cmd/project-planton/root.go` - Command registration (added three new commands)
- `cmd/project-planton/root/credential_list.go` - Minor updates for consistency

**Key Implementation Details:**

1. **Data Masking for Security:**

   ```go
   func maskSensitive(s string) string {
       if len(s) <= 8 {
           return "***"
       }
       return s[:4] + "..." + s[len(s)-4:]
   }
   ```

   Sensitive data (keys, secrets) is automatically masked in `credential:get` output.

2. **Provider Validation:**

   - Update command validates that provider type matches existing credential
   - Prevents accidental provider type changes
   - Clear error messages for validation failures

3. **Comprehensive Error Handling:**

   - Missing required flags validation
   - Invalid ID format detection
   - File existence checking (for GCP service account keys)
   - Backend connection error handling
   - Credential not found errors

4. **Consistent Command Structure:**
   - All commands follow same flag patterns
   - Unified provider-specific flag handling
   - Consistent output formatting

### Documentation Updates

**File Modified:**

- `cmd/project-planton/CLI-HELP.md` - Added comprehensive documentation for all three new commands (+397 lines, -5 lines)

**Documentation Includes:**

- Basic usage examples for each command
- Provider-specific examples (GCP, AWS, Azure)
- Complete flag documentation
- Error handling scenarios
- Use cases and best practices
- Security considerations

### Testing

Comprehensive testing was performed covering:

- ✅ Command availability and registration
- ✅ Help text accuracy
- ✅ Error handling (15 different error scenarios)
- ✅ Functional operations (5 real operations)
- ✅ Edge cases (optional flags, provider validation)
- ✅ Security features (data masking)

**Test Results:** 25/25 tests passed (100% success rate)

## Benefits

1. **Complete Lifecycle Management:**

   - Users can now manage credentials end-to-end
   - No need for manual database operations
   - Streamlined credential rotation workflows

2. **Improved Security:**

   - Easy credential rotation process
   - Ability to remove unused credentials
   - Sensitive data masking in outputs

3. **Better User Experience:**
