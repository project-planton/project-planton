# Backend Documentation and Code Cleanup

**Date**: January 01, 2026
**Type**: Refactoring | Documentation
**Components**: Backend Server, Developer Experience, Documentation

## Summary

Enhanced backend documentation with comprehensive local development guides and cleaned up temporary testing code. This change improves the developer onboarding experience by documenting Pulumi setup requirements and troubleshooting steps, while removing testing-specific branch checkout logic that is no longer needed.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

Developers setting up the backend locally were encountering Pulumi configuration errors without clear guidance on resolution. The backend README lacked comprehensive setup instructions, particularly around Pulumi backend configuration and common troubleshooting scenarios. Additionally, temporary testing code (branch checkout logic) remained in the codebase after the GCP credential fix was validated.

### Pain Points

- Missing documentation for local Pulumi backend setup
- No troubleshooting guide for `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE` errors
- Confusing error messages when running the backend locally
- Temporary testing code (branch checkout) left in production code
- Unused utility functions cluttering the credential resolver

## Solution / What's New

1. **Enhanced Backend README**: Added comprehensive local development section with quick start script, manual setup instructions, prerequisites, and troubleshooting guides.

2. **Pulumi Setup Documentation**: Documented both local file-based backend (for development) and cloud backend (for production) setup procedures.

3. **Troubleshooting Section**: Added detailed error resolution guides for common Pulumi configuration issues.

4. **Code Cleanup**: Removed temporary branch checkout logic that was added for testing the GCP credential fix.

5. **Entrypoint Fix**: Corrected su command syntax to use `-s /bin/sh` for proper shell invocation in Docker containers.

## Implementation Details

### Documentation Improvements

**File**: `app/backend/README.md`
- Added "Quick Start (Recommended)" section with `start-local.sh` script reference
- Documented manual setup steps with all required environment variables
- Added prerequisites section (MongoDB, Pulumi CLI)
- Created troubleshooting section for `PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE` errors
- Explained the difference between local and cloud Pulumi backends

**Key Addition - Quick Start**:
```bash
./start-local.sh
```

**Key Addition - Manual Setup**:
```bash
# Configure Pulumi for local backend
export PULUMI_CONFIG_PASSPHRASE=""
pulumi login --local

# Set environment variables
export MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/project_planton
export SERVER_PORT=50051
export PULUMI_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK=true
export PULUMI_AUTOMATION_API_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=true

# Run the server
make dev
```

### Code Cleanup

**File**: `pkg/iac/gitrepo/git_repo.go`
- Removed `Branch` constant that was added for testing purposes

**File**: `pkg/iac/pulumi/pulumimodule/module_directory.go`
- Removed conditional branch checkout logic that prioritized `gitrepo.Branch`
- Restored original version tag checkout behavior

**File**: `app/backend/internal/service/credential_resolver.go`
- Removed unused `min()` and `max()` helper functions
- Removed unused `math` import

**File**: `app/entrypoint-unified.sh`
- Fixed su command to use `-s /bin/sh` instead of `-` for explicit shell specification
- Ensures proper shell invocation for the appuser in Docker containers

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can set up the backend locally in minutes with clear instructions
- **Self-Service Troubleshooting**: Common errors are documented with solutions
- **Clearer Requirements**: Prerequisites are explicitly listed upfront

### For Code Quality
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed temporary testing code that served its purpose
- **Reduced Confusion**: No leftover branch checkout logic to puzzle future developers
- **Better Maintainability**: Removed unused utility functions

### For Operations
- **Consistent Shell Execution**: Fixed su command ensures reliable container startup
- **Clear Backend Configuration**: Documentation covers both development and production scenarios

## Impact

- **New Backend Developers**: Can now successfully run the backend locally on first try
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Entrypoint script fix ensures consistent Docker container behavior
- **Code Reviewers**: Less confusion about the purpose of branch checkout logic (now removed)
- **Documentation Users**: Have a comprehensive reference for local development setup

## Related Work

This cleanup follows the successful completion of the GCP credential base64 parsing fix (commits 5d08e36d, 5697f286, 27765148), which resolved `proto: syntax error` issues during Pulumi deployments. Once that fix was validated and working, the temporary branch checkout mechanism used for testing was no longer needed.
