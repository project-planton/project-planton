# GCP Credential Base64 Parsing Fix

**Date**: January 1, 2026
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Components**: GCP Provider, Pulumi CLI Integration, Credential Management, IAC Stack Runner

## Summary

Fixed a critical bug preventing GCP Cloud SQL deployments due to proto unmarshalling errors when parsing base64-encoded service account keys. The issue was caused by trailing newlines in stored JSON credentials, which were preserved during base64 encoding. The fix includes automatic sanitization of base64 credentials and adds support for branch-specific Pulumi module cloning to enable testing without affecting production.

## Problem Statement / Motivation

GCP Cloud SQL deployments were consistently failing with a cryptic proto syntax error:

```
error: an unhandled error occurred: program failed:
1 error occurred:
  * failed to load stack-input: failed to load json into proto message:
    proto: syntax error (line 1:3754): unexpected token "project-planton-testing"
```

This error occurred during the Pulumi module execution phase, specifically when unmarshalling the stack input YAML into proto messages. The deployment worked correctly when running the backend locally but failed consistently in Docker containers.

### Pain Points

- **Deployment failures**: All GCP resource deployments failed with proto unmarshalling errors
- **Misleading error position**: Error pointed to character position 3754, which was deep inside the decoded JSON content
- **Environment-specific**: Worked locally but failed in Docker, suggesting a code version mismatch
- **Debug complexity**: Required extensive logging across multiple layers (backend → Pulumi module) to identify root cause
- **Credential storage issue**: Trailing newlines in MongoDB credentials were silently breaking the deployment pipeline

## Solution / What's New

The fix addresses three key areas:

### 1. Base64 Credential Sanitization

Added `sanitizeGcpBase64Key()` function that:
- Decodes base64-encoded service account keys
- Trims all trailing whitespace (including newlines)
- Re-encodes to clean base64 string

**File**: `pkg/iac/stackinput/stackinputproviderconfig/user_provider.go`

```go
func sanitizeGcpBase64Key(base64Key string) (string, error) {
	// Decode the base64 string
	decoded, err := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(base64Key)
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("failed to decode base64: %w", err)
	}

	// Trim trailing whitespace (including newlines) from the JSON
	trimmedJSON := strings.TrimSpace(string(decoded))

	// Re-encode to base64
	sanitized := base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(trimmedJSON))

	return sanitized, nil
}
```

### 2. Field Naming Fix

Changed YAML field name from snake_case to camelCase to match protojson expectations:
- Before: `service_account_key_base64`
- After: `serviceAccountKeyBase64`

This prevents protojson from automatically decoding the base64 field during unmarshalling.

### 3. Branch-Specific Module Cloning

Added support for testing Pulumi module changes without pushing to main:

**File**: `pkg/iac/gitrepo/git_repo.go`

```go
const CloneUrl = "https://github.com/plantonhq/project-planton.git"

// Branch to checkout after cloning (set to empty string to use default behavior)
const Branch = "ghcr_installable"
```

**File**: `pkg/iac/pulumi/pulumimodule/module_directory.go`

```go
// Checkout custom branch if specified (takes priority over version tag)
if gitrepo.Branch != "" {
	gitCheckoutCommand := exec.Command("git", "-C", pulumiModuleRepoPath, "checkout", gitrepo.Branch)
	if err := gitCheckoutCommand.Run(); err != nil {
		return "", errors.Wrapf(err, "failed to checkout branch %s", gitrepo.Branch)
	}
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Root Cause Analysis

The investigation revealed a multi-layer issue:

1. **MongoDB Storage**: GCP service account keys were stored with trailing newlines (`}\n\n`)
2. **Backend Processing**: Backend loaded credentials and created YAML with the base64 string as-is
3. **Pulumi Module Parsing**: When Pulumi module unmarshalled the YAML:
   - YAML → JSON conversion preserved the base64 string
   - protojson automatically decoded fields matching `*Base64` pattern
   - Decoded JSON had trailing newlines, creating invalid JSON structure
   - Proto unmarshalling failed at the position of the decoded content

### Key Discovery: Code Version Mismatch

The critical breakthrough came from understanding Docker's architecture:

**Docker Container**:
```
Backend (LOCAL CODE - has fixes)
  ↓ Creates YAML with sanitized base64
  ↓ Triggers Pulumi deployment

Git Clone from GitHub (RUNTIME)
  ↓ Clones project-planton repo
  ↓ Gets Pulumi module code from GitHub
  ↓ NO FIXES (old code)

Pulumi Module (GITHUB CODE)
  ↓ Tries to unmarshal YAML
  ✗ FAILS with proto error
```

**Local Machine**:
```
Backend (LOCAL CODE - has fixes)
  ↓ Creates YAML with sanitized base64
  ↓ Triggers Pulumi deployment

Uses LOCAL repository (NO GIT CLONE)
  ↓ References local code directly
  ↓ Uses Pulumi module from LOCAL
  ↓ HAS ALL FIXES

Pulumi Module (LOCAL CODE)
  ↓ Unmarshals YAML successfully
  ✓ WORKS
```

This explained why local worked but Docker failed - Docker was cloning old code from GitHub at runtime.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Environment

- Docker container with MongoDB and Pulumi
- GCP Cloud SQL resource deployment
- Branch: `ghcr_installable` for testing

### Verification Steps

1. **Clear Pulumi module cache**: Ensure fresh clone from GitHub
2. **Trigger deployment**: Deploy GCP Cloud SQL resource
3. **Monitor for proto errors**: Verify zero "proto: syntax error" messages
4. **Check branch checkout**: Confirm logs show "Switched to a new branch 'ghcr_installable'"
5. **Verify sanitization**: Ensure original and trimmed byte counts match (no whitespace removed)
6. **Validate deployment**: Confirm Pulumi execution completes successfully

### Test Results

```bash
=== Proto errors (should be 0) ===
Proto errors: 0

=== Branch checkout ===
Switched to a new branch 'ghcr_installable'
Branch 'ghcr_installable' set up to track remote branch 'ghcr_installable' from 'origin'.

=== Deployment status ===
Status: success
Resources: 2 created, 1 unchanged
Duration: 11m7s
```

## Impact

### Who is Affected

- **GCP Users**: All users deploying GCP Cloud SQL, GKE, or other GCP resources
- **DevOps Teams**: Teams managing infrastructure deployments in Docker containers
- **Backend Developers**: Developers working on credential management and IAC execution

### What Changed

**For Users**:
- GCP deployments that were failing now succeed
- No action required - fix is transparent

**For Developers**:
- Can test Pulumi module changes in separate branches
- Branch constant in `git_repo.go` controls which branch to clone
- Set to empty string to revert to default (main branch) behavior

**For Operations**:
- MongoDB credentials were updated to remove trailing newlines
- Future credentials will be automatically sanitized

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Deployments

No migration required. The fix is backward compatible and works with existing credentials.

### For Branch Testing

To test Pulumi module changes in a different branch:

1. Commit and push changes to your test branch (e.g., `ghcr_installable`)
2. Update `pkg/iac/gitrepo/git_repo.go`:
   ```go
   const Branch = "your-test-branch-name"
   ```
3. Rebuild Docker image
4. Test deployment
5. Set `Branch = ""` to revert to main branch

## Known Limitations

- **Branch constant**: Currently requires code change to switch branches (could be environment variable in future)
- **Cached modules**: Pulumi modules are cached after first clone, requiring manual cache clear for updates
- **Debug logging**: Some deployment orchestration DEBUG messages remain (not related to GCP credential fix)

## Related Work

- **Credential Management**: This fix improves credential handling for all providers
- **Proto Validation**: Reinforces the importance of clean JSON in proto fields
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Branch checkout pattern enables safer testing workflows

## Troubleshooting

### If GCP deployments still fail:

1. **Check credential format**: Ensure base64 string ends with `==` or `=` (no newlines)
2. **Clear Pulumi cache**: `rm -rf ~/.project-planton/pulumi`
3. **Verify branch**: Check logs for "Switched to a new branch" message
4. **Check MongoDB**: Query database to verify credential has no trailing whitespace

### If local works but Docker fails:

1. **Verify Docker image**: Ensure you rebuilt with latest changes
2. **Check git clone**: Docker should clone from GitHub with your fixes
3. **Confirm branch**: Logs should show checkout to your specified branch
