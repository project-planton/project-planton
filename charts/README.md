# PlantonCloud Quick Start InfraCharts

This repository contains Quick Start InfraCharts designed to simplify the onboarding and provisioning of cloud
infrastructure resources. Quick Start InfraCharts provide predefined, composable sets of resources to rapidly deploy common
cloud scenarios, enhancing the developer experience by abstracting complex configurations while preserving flexibility.

## Purpose

Quick Start InfraCharts help development teams quickly set up cloud infrastructure through simplified initial provisioning.
After deployment, resources within these charts can be managed individually, offering both ease of use and long-term
flexibility.

## Available Charts

Currently available Quick Start InfraCharts:

- [AWS ECS Quick Start Chart](ecs-environment/README.md): Provides streamlined provisioning for AWS ECS services.

Additional charts for other cloud providers and services will be added over time.

## How to Use

1. Select a Quick Start Chart relevant to your needs.
2. Follow the chart-specific README for configuration parameters and deployment instructions.

## Important Considerations

- Quick Start InfraCharts are intended solely for initial provisioning.
- Individual resource management post-deployment should follow standard practices.
