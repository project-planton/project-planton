# AWS Terraform State Backend InfraChart

The AWS Terraform State Backend InfraChart provides a streamlined way to rapidly provision cloud resources necessary to
securely store and manage Terraform state files. This chart specifically focuses on creating an AWS S3 bucket and
DynamoDB table essential for Terraform state storage and locking, ensuring ease of use and robust infrastructure
management for development and operations teams.

The resources defined by this chart are available in the [templates](templates) folder. Configuration parameters are
managed through [values.yaml](values.yaml).
