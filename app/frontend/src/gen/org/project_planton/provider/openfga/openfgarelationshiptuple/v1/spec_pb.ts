/**
 * OpenFgaRelationshipTupleSpec defines the configuration for an OpenFGA Relationship Tuple.
 *
 * A relationship tuple is the core data structure in OpenFGA that represents a relationship
 * between a user (or userset) and an object through a specific relation. Together with an
 * authorization model, relationship tuples determine whether a user has access to an object.
 *
 * The tuple consists of three required parts:
 * - user: Who or what is being granted access (structured as type + id + optional relation)
 * - relation: The type of access or relationship (e.g., "viewer", "editor", "owner")
 * - object: What is being accessed (structured as type + id)
 *
 * Optionally, a condition can be specified to add dynamic access rules that are evaluated
 * at check time using the provided context.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Relationship tuples are immutable in OpenFGA. Changing any field requires
 * deleting the old tuple and creating a new one. Terraform handles this automatically.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: OpenFGA only has a Terraform provider - there is no Pulumi provider available.
 * This component must use Terraform/Tofu as the provisioner.
 *
 * Reference:
 * - Terraform: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/openfga/openfga/latest/docs/resources/relationship_tuple
 * - OpenFGA Docs: https://openfga.dev/docs/concepts#what-is-a-relationship-tuple
