**Simplifying Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Deployment with a Standardized, Declarative API**

ProjectPlanton's core API design philosophy centers on providing a **standardized and simplified structure** for defining infrastructure resources, repurposed for seamless multi-cloud deployment. Inspired by the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM), the API abstracts the complexities of different cloud providers, allowing developers to define their desired infrastructure in a consistent and declarative manner.

## Unified Resource Model (MURM)

- **Consistency Across Clouds**: The API offers a **Multi-Cloud Unified Resource Model (MURM)** that standardizes how resources are defined, regardless of the underlying cloud provider.
- **Abstraction of Cloud-Specific Details**: By abstracting provider-specific nuances, developers can focus on the desired state of their infrastructure without worrying about implementation details.

## Declarative Configuration

- **Standard Structure**: Resources are defined using a simplified, standard structure with familiar fields:
    - `apiVersion`
    - `kind`
    - `metadata`
    - `spec`
    - `status`

- **Desired State Focus**: Developers declare **what** they want to achieve, and Project Planton handles **how** to achieve it.

## Configuration as Data

- **Immutable Manifests**: Treats configuration files as immutable data, which can be version-controlled, audited, and shared.
- **Best Practices Alignment**: Embraces industry best practices by promoting declarative infrastructure and immutable deployments.
- **YAML Manifests**: Developers write manifests in YAML, using the standard structure to define infrastructure components like databases, clusters, and services.
- **Unified Definitions**: The `spec` field contains the desired configuration, abstracted from provider-specific implementations.

**Example Manifest Structure:**

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.project-planton.org/v1
kind: GkeCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  projectId: my-gcp-project
  region: us-central1
  nodePools:
    - name: default-pool
      machineType: n1-standard-1
      nodeCount: 3
```

## Protocol Buffer Definitions

- **Strong Typing and Validation**: Using Protobuf ensures that resource definitions are strongly typed, enabling robust validation and error checking.
- **Language-Agnostic SDKs**: Protobuf allows for the generation of SDKs in multiple programming languages, facilitating broader adoption and integration.
- **Versioning and Documentation**: Protobuf schemas are published to the Buf Schema Registry (BSR), aiding in version control and automatic documentation generation.

## Simplification & Familiarity

- **Kubernetes-Like Experience**: By mirroring the Kubernetes API structure, developers familiar with Kubernetes can easily adopt Project Planton without a steep learning curve.
- **Reduced Complexity**: The standardized approach minimizes the need to learn different APIs for each cloud provider.
