When it comes to DevOps, cloud, and infrastructure management, most think of AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes as the go-to platforms. However, ProjectPlanton’s capabilities extend far beyond these major cloud providers, bringing a consistent deployment framework for a wide range of managed services. As long as a component can be deployed using Pulumi, ProjectPlanton can bring it under its unified API-driven framework, offering consistent, declarative management for all types of managed services.

Currently, ProjectPlanton provides deployment APIs for managed services such as Snowflake databases, MongoDB databases on Atlas, and Kafka clusters on Confluent Cloud. These capabilities illustrate how ProjectPlanton can provide consistent tooling for managed services, offering an experience that is just as seamless as deploying infrastructure on AWS, GCP, or Kubernetes.

**Benefits of Using ProjectPlanton for Managed Services**:

## Beyond Traditional Cloud

While many deployment tools are optimized for AWS, GCP, and Azure, ProjectPlanton provides consistent support for managed services that are hosted outside these cloud environments. Whether it's deploying a Snowflake database, a managed MongoDB instance on Atlas, or a Confluent Kafka cluster, ProjectPlanton ensures that you use the same deployment pattern, making the learning curve flatter and management easier.

## Declarative API

ProjectPlanton follows a declarative API model for deploying managed services, providing a higher-level abstraction to users. Just as you would write a Kubernetes manifest for deploying a workload, ProjectPlanton allows you to define a managed service deployment using the same consistent structure. This approach simplifies the management of cloud databases, messaging systems, and other managed services.

## Pulumi for Customization

ProjectPlanton uses Pulumi to power its deployments, meaning that any managed service component that Pulumi can deploy can be seamlessly integrated into ProjectPlanton’s API-driven framework. Developers can use the default Pulumi modules provided by ProjectPlanton, or fork them for customization to meet their specific use cases. This flexibility ensures that you have complete control over managed service deployments.

**Example Manifests for Deploying Managed Services**:

The following examples demonstrate how ProjectPlanton uses consistent API definitions to deploy different managed services.

- **MongoDB Atlas Cluster**:

```yaml
apiVersion: atlas.project-planton.org/v1
kind: MongodbAtlas
metadata:
  name: example-mongodb-cluster
spec:
  cluster_config:
    project_id: <enter-atlas-project-id>
    cluster_type: REPLICASET
    electable_nodes: 3
    priority: 4
    read_only_nodes: 0
    cloud_backup: true
    auto_scaling_disk_gb_enabled: true
    mongo_db_major_version: "6.0"
    provider_name: AWS
    provider_instance_size_name: M10
  ```

- **Snowflake Database**:

```yaml
apiVersion: snowflake.project-planton.org/v1
kind: SnowflakeDatabase
metadata:
  name: example-snowflake-database
spec:
  catalog: "DEFAULT_CATALOG"
  comment: "Example Snowflake database"
  data_retention_time_in_days: 7
  is_transient: false
  log_level: "INFO"
  storage_serialization_policy: "OPTIMIZED"
  ```

- **Confluent Kafka Cluster**:

```yaml
apiVersion: confluent.project-planton.org/v1
kind: ConfluentKafka
metadata:
  name: example-confluent-kafka-cluster
spec:
  cloud: AWS
  availability: MULTI_ZONE
  environment: example-environment
  ```

**Summary**:

ProjectPlanton’s framework goes beyond typical cloud infrastructure and extends into the realm of managed services, providing a consistent, declarative, and higher-level abstraction for deployments. Whether you're deploying a Snowflake database, a MongoDB cluster on Atlas, or a Kafka cluster on Confluent, ProjectPlanton ensures a unified experience, leveraging its Pulumi-powered backend and standardized APIs. This approach makes it easier to manage deployments, expand capabilities, and deliver value without being limited by the traditional boundaries of cloud infrastructure. The future of cloud operations is not just in deploying VMs or Kubernetes clusters—it is also about seamlessly managing all the components that make up modern cloud-native applications, and ProjectPlanton is the key to that transformation.
