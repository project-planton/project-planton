# Debug ProjectPlanton Pulumi Modules

ProjectPlanton is an open-source framework designed to simplify multi-cloud deployments by providing a consistent developer experience across different cloud providers. One of the key advantages of using Pulumi within ProjectPlanton is the ability to debug infrastructure as code (IaC) programs using standard debugging tools. This powerful capability enhances productivity and accelerates troubleshooting.

Pulumi recently introduced the ability to debug programs using breakpoints when running them via the Pulumi CLI. This feature allows developers to step through their code, inspect variables, and understand the execution flow in real-time.

**Announcement Blog Post:** [Next-level IaC: Breakpoint Debugging for Pulumi Programs](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/next-level-iac-breakpoint-debugging/)

In this guide, we'll provide a detailed walkthrough on how to debug ProjectPlanton Pulumi modules written in Go using GoLand. We'll cover enabling debugging in your existing modules, configuring your environment, setting up necessary environment variables, and running your Pulumi program in debug mode.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **GoLand IDE**: Installed and configured for Go development.
- **Go Programming Language**: Compatible version with your Pulumi modules.
- **Pulumi CLI**: Installed and authenticated with your Pulumi backend.
- **Delve Debugger (`dlv`)**: Installed and accessible in your system's `PATH`.

## Overview

Debugging Pulumi programs involves attaching a debugger to the process that runs your IaC code. Since Pulumi executes your program via the Pulumi CLI, we need to:

1. **Enable the debugging configuration** in your existing Pulumi modules.
2. **create manifest yaml file** for the deployment component.
3. **Configure GoLand** to attach to the running Delve debugger.
4. **Run Pulumi** with debugging enabled.

## Step-by-Step Guide

By following these steps, you can set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code just like you would with any other Go application.

### 1. Prepare Your Pulumi Module for Debugging

The Pulumi modules maintained by ProjectPlanton already include:

- A `debug.sh` script in the root directory.
- A `Pulumi.yaml` file with the `binary` option configured but commented out.

This setup is designed to make it easy for developers to enable debugging when needed.

#### Examine the `debug.sh` Script

The `debug.sh` script typically contains:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
go build -o goapp -gcflags "all=-N -l" .
exec dlv --listen=:2345 --headless=true --api-version=2 exec ./goapp
```

- **Explanation:**
    - `go build -o goapp -gcflags "all=-N -l" .` compiles your Go program into an executable named `goapp` with optimizations and inlining disabled (`-N -l`), which is crucial for debugging.
    - `exec dlv --listen=:2345 --headless=true --api-version=2 exec ./goapp` runs the `goapp` binary under Delve in headless mode, listening on port `2345`.

#### Check `Pulumi.yaml` Configuration

Your `Pulumi.yaml` file should look like this:

```yaml
name: aws-module-test-pulumi-project
runtime:
  name: go
#  options:
#    binary: ./debug.sh
```

- **Note:**
    - The `binary` option is commented out by default to facilitate normal execution.
    - When you need to debug, you can simply uncomment the `binary` option.

### 2. Enable Debugging in `Pulumi.yaml`

To enable debugging:

1. **Uncomment the `binary` option** in your `Pulumi.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   name: aws-module-test-pulumi-project
   runtime:
     name: go
     options:
       binary: ./debug.sh
   ```

    - This tells Pulumi to execute the custom `debug.sh` script instead of the default Go runtime.

2. **Ensure the `debug.sh` Script is Executable**

   ```bash
   chmod +x debug.sh
   ```

    - This step may have already been done, but it's good to verify.

### 3. Set up deployment-component manifest file

All `project-planton` pulumi operations would require `--manifest` flag, which contains the path to the deployment-component manifest file. This file defines the configuration for the deployment component, following the protobuf definitions specified by ProjectPlanton.

Before running `project-planton pulumi up`, you need to set up this file.

#### Example `manifest.yaml` File

Create a `manifest.yaml` file with your deployment configuration. Here's an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsDynamodb
metadata:
    name: example-dynamodb-test
spec:
    table:
    billingMode: PROVISIONED
    hashKey:
        name: id
        type: S
```

- **Explanation:**
    - The `manifest.yaml` contains the API resource definition.
    - It specifies the `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, and `spec` for the deployment component.
    - This configuration follows the protobuf definitions for the deployment component.
    - Adjust the values according to your specific deployment requirements.

### 4. Configure Remote Debugging in GoLand

#### 4.1 Create a New Run/Debug Configuration

- Go to **Run** > **Edit Configurations...** in the menu bar.
- Click the **+** icon to add a new configuration.
- Select **Go Remote** from the list.

#### 4.2 Set Up the Configuration

- **Name**: `Pulumi Remote Debug`
- **Host**: `127.0.0.1`
- **Port**: `2345` (must match the port specified in your `debug.sh` script)
- **Mode**: `Attach to running remote Delve debugger`
- **API Version**: Ensure it's set to `2` to match the `--api-version=2` in your script.

**Configuration should look like this:**

![GoLand Remote Debug Configuration](/images/guide/debug-pulumi-modules/img_1.png)

#### 4.3 Apply and Save

- Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the configuration.

### 5. Run Pulumi

Run your Pulumi program with the desired stack:

```bash
project-planton pulumi up --stack <stack-fqdn> --manifest <manifest-yaml-path>
```

- **Important:**
    - Replace `<stack-fqdn>` with your fully qualified stack name (e.g., `yourOrg/yourProject/yourStack`).
    - The Pulumi execution will start and wait until a debugger is attached before proceeding.
    - Pulumi will block execution and display a message indicating it's waiting for a debugger to attach.

### 6. Attach the Debugger

- In the top-right corner of GoLand, select your new `Pulumi Remote Debug` configuration.
- Click the **Debug** button (green bug icon) to start the debugging session.
- GoLand will connect to the Delve debugger running your Pulumi program.

**Observation:**

- Pulumi execution is blocked until the remote debugger is connected.
- Once you start the debugger in GoLand, the Pulumi program will proceed with execution.

### 7. Debug Your Program

Once connected:

- Execution will pause at your breakpoints.
- Use GoLand's debugging tools to:

    - **Step Over** (`F8`): Execute the next line of code without entering any functions.
    - **Step Into** (`F7`): Dive into functions to debug them line by line.
    - **Step Out** (`Shift+F8`): Exit the current function and return to the caller.
    - **Resume Program** (`F9`): Continue execution until the next breakpoint or program termination.

- Inspect variables, evaluate expressions, and monitor the call stack.
- Use the **Variables** pane to view local and global variables.
- Use the **Watches** pane to monitor specific expressions or variables.

### 8. Continue Execution

- After you've finished debugging, resume the program's execution by clicking **Resume Program** or pressing `F9`.
- Let the Pulumi CLI complete its execution and update your infrastructure accordingly.
- Check the Pulumi CLI output to verify the deployment results.

### 9. Disable Debugging for Normal Execution

When you want to run your program without debugging:

1. **Comment Out the `binary` Option** in `Pulumi.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   name: aws-module-test-pulumi-project
   runtime:
     name: go
   #  options:
   #    binary: ./debug.sh
   ```

2. **Run Pulumi Normally**:

   ```bash
   project-planton pulumi up --stack <stack-fqdn> --manifest <manifest-yaml-path>
   ```

- This will execute your Pulumi program without invoking the `debug.sh` script.

### 10. Iterating and Debugging Again

- If you need to debug again, simply uncomment the `binary` option in `Pulumi.yaml` and repeat the steps.
- This approach makes it easy for developers to switch between normal execution and debugging mode.

## Additional Notes

### Using `project-planton pulumi preview` and `project-planton pulumi up`

- **Pulumi runs your program twice during `project-planton pulumi up`**: once for the preview and once for the actual update.
- Both runs will trigger the debugger and wait for you to attach.
- To debug only one of these runs:

    - Debug only the preview: `project-planton pulumi preview`
    - Debug only the update without preview: `project-planton pulumi up --skip-preview`

### Ensuring Delve Is Installed

If Delve (`dlv`) is not installed, install it with:

```bash
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
```

- Ensure that `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your system's `PATH`.
- Verify the installation with:

  ```bash
  dlv version
  ```

### Understanding Build Flags

- The `-gcflags "all=-N -l"` flags in the `go build` command disable optimizations and inlining.
- This ensures the debugger can accurately step through your code line by line.
- Without these flags, the compiler might optimize away certain variables or rearrange code, making debugging difficult.
