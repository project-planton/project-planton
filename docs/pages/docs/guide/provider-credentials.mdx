Pulumi providers require proper credentials to deploy infrastructure on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes. In ProjectPlanton, default providers are set up without any abstraction, and Pulumi handles the process of looking up credentials from the environment. However, ProjectPlanton provides an additional method for configuring credentials using **Credential APIs** to simplify the setup process.

This guide explains the steps required to set up credentials for Pulumi providers, focusing on AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes, using either environment-based credentials or the ProjectPlanton Credential API.

## Default Credential Lookup

By default, `ProjectPlanton` does not introduce any abstractions over Pulumi's standard credential management methods, allowing users to set up credentials as they would with any Pulumi project.

Pulumi providers can use credentials directly from the environment variables or configuration files that are available on your machine. The following are the default methods for each provider:

- **AWS**: Pulumi looks up credentials from environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`) or from the AWS credentials file.
- **GCP**: Credentials are looked up from the environment variable `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` or from the active gcloud configuration.
- **Azure**: Credentials are looked up from environment variables (`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`).
- **Kubernetes**: Credentials can be obtained from the default kubeconfig file or from environment variables related to your cluster.

## Credential APIs

To provide an additional method of setting up credentials, ProjectPlanton offers [Credential APIs](https://github.com/project-planton/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/credential) that allow users to specify credentials in a YAML file. This file can then be passed to the `project-planton pulumi up` command using specific flags. This is particularly useful when managing credentials for multiple providers or sharing configurations across a team.

## AWS Provider

### Default

By default, AWS credentials can be provided using environment variables or from the AWS credentials file. Pulumi will look for the following:

- **Environment Variables**: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`
- **Credentials File**: Typically located at `~/.aws/credentials`.

### Credential API

To use the custom credential method provided by ProjectPlanton, you can define the AWS credentials in a YAML file and pass it using the `--aws-credential` flag:

**Example AWS Credential Spec**:
```yaml
account_id: "987654321098"
access_key_id: "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
secret_access_key: "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
region: "us-east-1"
```

Once the aws credential yaml is created, pass it to the command

```shell
project-planton pulumi up --manifest deployment-component-manifest.yaml --aws-credential aws-credential.yaml
```

## GCP Provider

### Default

Pulumi looks up GCP credentials from the following sources:

- **Environment Variable**: `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` containing the service account JSON key.
- **Active gcloud Configuration**: Credentials can be pulled from the gcloud CLI configuration.

### Credential API

To use ProjectPlanton's Credential API for GCP, define credentials in a YAML file and pass it using the `--gcp-credential` flag:

**Example GCP Credential Spec**:

```yaml
gcp_organization_id: "1234567890"
service_account_key_base64: "your-base64-encoded-service-account-key"
```

Once the gcp credential yaml is created, pass it to the command

```shell
project-planton pulumi up --manifest deployment-component-manifest.yaml --gcp-credential gcp-credential.yaml
```

## Azure Provider

### Default

Azure credentials are looked up from environment variables:

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

### Credential API

For Azure, use the following YAML format and pass it using the `--azure-credential` flag:

**Example Azure Credential Spec**:

```yaml
client_id: "e8a95d4b-09c5-412b-97f8-123456789abc"
client_secret: "EXAMPLE_SECRET"
tenant_id: "12345678-9abc-def0-1234-56789abcdef0"
subscription_id: "87654321-4321-1234-5678-123456789abc"
```

Once the azure credential yaml is created, pass it to the command

```shell
project-planton pulumi up --manifest deployment-component-manifest.yaml --azure-credential azure-credential.yaml
```

## Kubernetes Provider

### Default

Kubernetes credentials can be obtained from:

- **kubeconfig File**: Typically located at `~/.kube/config`
- **Environment Variables**: Related to your Kubernetes cluster credentials.

### Credential API

ProjectPlanton also allows you to define Kubernetes credentials in a YAML file, passed using the `--kubernetes-credential` flag:

**Example Kubernetes Cluster Credential Spec**:

```yaml
kubernetes_provider: "GKE"
gke_cluster:
  cluster_endpoint: "https://example-cluster-endpoint"
  cluster_ca_data: "EXAMPLE_CA_DATA"
  service_account_key_base64: "eyJraWQiOiAiQUJDREVGIiwgImFsZyI6ICJzZXN0ZXEifQ.EXAMPLE"
```

Once the kubernetes cluster credential yaml is created, pass it to the command

```shell
project-planton pulumi up --manifest deployment-component-manifest.yaml --kubernetes-cluster kubernetes-cluster.yaml
```
