# Project Planton

> **Deploy anywhere with one workflow.** Write declarative YAML once, deploy to AWS, GCP, Azure, or Kubernetes with the same CLI and consistent experience.

## What is Project Planton?

An open-source multi-cloud deployment framework that brings Kubernetes-style consistency to infrastructure deployments everywhere. No vendor lock-in, no artificial abstractions—just provider-specific configurations with a unified structure and workflow.

## Why Project Planton?

- **One structure, any cloud** - Kubernetes Resource Model (apiVersion/kind/metadata/spec) for all deployments
- **Validate before deploy** - Protocol Buffer validations catch errors in seconds, not minutes
- **Zero abstraction** - Provider-specific configs preserve cloud capabilities, consistent experience across all
- **Choose your IaC** - Built-in Pulumi and Terraform/OpenTofu modules with feature parity
- **Build on top** - Auto-generated SDKs in Go, Python, TypeScript, Java from Protocol Buffer definitions

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the CLI

```bash
brew install project-planton/tap/project-planton
```

### 2. Create a YAML Manifest

Example: Deploy Redis to Kubernetes using the [redis-kubernetes](https://buf.build/project-planton/apis/file/main:project/planton/provider/kubernetes/workload/rediskubernetes/v1/spec.proto) deployment component.

```yaml
apiVersion: kubernetes.project-planton.org/v1
kind: RedisKubernetes
metadata:
  name: payments
  id: payments-namespace
spec:
  container:
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 2Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 100Mi
    isPersistenceEnabled: true
    diskSize: 1Gi
```

You can create similar manifests for [AWS VPC](https://github.com/plantonhq/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider/aws/awsvpc/v1), [GKE Cluster](https://github.com/plantonhq/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider/gcp/gkecluster/v1), [Kafka on Kubernetes](https://github.com/plantonhq/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider/kubernetes/workload/kafkakubernetes/v1), and [many more](https://github.com/plantonhq/project-planton/tree/main/apis/project/planton/provider).

### 3. Deploy

```bash
project-planton pulumi up --manifest redis.yaml
```
