# T09: Cloud Resource Apply Command with Automatic Deployment

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** December 11, 2025
**Type:** Feature Enhancement
**Changelog:** `2025-12-11-085026-cloud-resource-apply-automatic-deployment.md`

---

## Overview

Enhanced the `cloud-resource:apply` command to automatically trigger Pulumi deployments when creating or updating cloud resources. The command now uses the `ApplyCloudResource` API for a simpler, more reliable upsert operation, and provides clear feedback about deployment status to users.

## Problem Statement

The `cloud-resource:apply` command was missing automatic deployment triggering. When users applied a cloud resource, the resource was created or updated in the database, but Pulumi deployment was not automatically triggered. This required users to manually call the deployment API separately, creating a poor user experience.

Additionally, the command implementation was using manual create/update logic instead of leveraging the existing `ApplyCloudResource` API, which already handled the upsert operation correctly.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Added Automatic Deployment Trigger to ApplyCloudResource API

**File:** `app/backend/internal/service/cloud_resource_service.go`

Added automatic Pulumi deployment triggering to the `ApplyCloudResource` method, matching the behavior of `CreateCloudResource` and `UpdateCloudResource`:

```go
// Trigger Pulumi deployment automatically (credentials will be resolved from database)
if s.stackUpdateService != nil {
    // Create a deployment request (no provider_config needed - will be resolved automatically)
    deployReq := &connect.Request[backendv1.DeployCloudResourceRequest]{
        Msg: &backendv1.DeployCloudResourceRequest{
            CloudResourceId: resultResource.ID.Hex(),
        },
    }

    // Trigger deployment asynchronously (don't wait for it)
    go func() {
        _, _ = s.stackUpdateService.DeployCloudResource(context.Background(), deployReq)
    }()
}
```

**Impact:** Now all three operations (Create, Update, Apply) consistently trigger deployments automatically.

### 2. Refactored CLI Command to Use ApplyCloudResource API

**File:** `cmd/project-planton/root/cloud_resource_apply.go`

**Before:** Manual implementation that:

- Listed all resources to find existing ones
- Called `CreateCloudResource` or `UpdateCloudResource` separately
- Required complex logic to determine create vs update

**After:** Simplified implementation that:

- Uses `ApplyCloudResource` API directly (single call handles both create and update)
- Validates YAML manifest before making API call
- Provides better user feedback with progress messages
- Shows deployment status information

**Key Changes:**

1. **YAML Validation**: Added validation to check for required fields (`kind`, `metadata.name`) before API call
2. **Better User Feedback**:
   - Shows "Applying cloud resource: kind=X, name=Y" message
   - Displays "Created" or "Updated" action clearly
   - Shows deployment status message at the end
3. **Simplified Logic**: Removed ~50 lines of manual create/update detection code

**Example Output:**

```
Applying cloud resource: kind=GcpCloudSql, name=gcp-postgres-example
Checking if resource exists...
✅ Cloud resource created successfully!

Action: Created
ID: 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011
Name: gcp-postgres-example
Kind: GcpCloudSql
Created At: 2025-12-11 08:50:26
Updated At: 2025-12-11 08:50:26

🚀 Pulumi deployment has been triggered automatically.
   Deployment is running in the background.
   Use 'project-planton stack-job:list' to check deployment status.
```

### 3. Updated CLI Documentation

**File:** `cmd/project-planton/CLI-HELP.md`

Updated the `cloud-resource:apply` documentation to:

- Reflect the actual command output format
- Document the automatic deployment behavior
- Update sample outputs to match real command output
- Explain how the `ApplyCloudResource` API works internally

## Technical Details

### API Flow

1. **CLI Command** → Reads YAML manifest, validates it
2. **ApplyCloudResource API** → Checks if resource exists (by `name` + `kind`)
   - If exists: Updates resource
   - If not exists: Creates resource
3. **Automatic Deployment** → Triggers `DeployCloudResource` asynchronously
   - Credentials resolved from database based on provider
   - Stack job created with "in_progress" status
   - Pulumi deployment runs in background
4. **Response** → Returns resource with `created` flag

### Consistency Across All Operations

Now all three cloud resource operations have consistent behavior:

| Operation | API                   | Deployment Trigger |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Create    | `CreateCloudResource` | ✅ Automatic       |
| Update    | `UpdateCloudResource` | ✅ Automatic       |
| Apply     | `ApplyCloudResource`  | ✅ Automatic (new) |

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: All three operations (Create, Update, Apply) now trigger deployments
- **Simplicity**: Single API call instead of manual create/update logic
- **User Experience**: Clear feedback about what's happening and deployment status
- **Reliability**: Uses the same proven upsert logic as the API

## Files Changed

### Backend

- `app/backend/internal/service/cloud_resource_service.go` (+15 lines)
  - Added deployment trigger to `ApplyCloudResource` method

### CLI

- `cmd/project-planton/root/cloud_resource_apply.go` (+66 lines, -22 lines)
  - Refactored to use `ApplyCloudResource` API
  - Added YAML validation
  - Improved user feedback

### Documentation

- `cmd/project-planton/CLI-HELP.md` (+50 lines modified)
  - Updated documentation to match actual behavior
  - Added deployment status information

## Testing

The changes were tested with:

- Creating new GCP Cloud SQL resources
- Updating existing resources (storage size changes)
- Verifying automatic deployment triggers
- Confirming deployment status messages appear correctly

## Related Work

This enhancement builds on the database-driven credential management system implemented in **T08**, which enables automatic credential resolution during deployments. The `ApplyCloudResource` API was already implemented but was missing the deployment trigger that existed in `CreateCloudResource` and `UpdateCloudResource`.

## Migration Notes

No migration required. This is a backward-compatible enhancement that adds functionality without breaking existing behavior.
