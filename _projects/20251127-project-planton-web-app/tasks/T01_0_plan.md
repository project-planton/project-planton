# T01: Initial Task Plan - Project Planton Web App

**Status:** 📋 PENDING REVIEW  
**Created:** November 27, 2025  
**Plan Type:** Initial breakdown for full-stack web application

---

## Overview

This plan breaks down the development of Project Planton Web App into manageable phases, balancing the immediate need for a working demo (2 days) with the long-term goal of a production-ready full-stack application.

**Strategy**: Frontend-first with mock data, backend requirements emerge naturally, full integration follows.

  - `project-planton create` → call backend API
  - `project-planton get` → fetch from backend

**Backward Compatibility:**
- [ ] CLI works standalone (without backend)
- [ ] Flag to enable/disable backend mode
- [ ] Graceful fallback if backend unavailable

**Data Synchronization:**
- [ ] CLI operations write to backend
- [ ] Backend operations accessible via CLI
- [ ] Shared data model (Protocol Buffers)

**Deliverables:**
- CLI integrated with backend
- Maintains standalone capability
- All operations persisted

## Minimum Viable Demo (for Meetup)

If time is tight, **absolute minimum for meetup demo**:

✅ **Must Have:**
1. Frontend with mock data showing:
   - Deployment component catalog
   - Resource list view
   - Creation flow (even if mocked)
   - Visual polish

2. Clear vision demonstrated:
   - What Project Planton does
   - How web UI makes it accessible
   - Value proposition obvious

❌ **Nice to Have (can come after meetup):**
- Real backend integration
- Database persistence
- CLI integration
- Full deployment capability

**Fallback Position**: Frontend-only demo with mock data is still valuable and impressive.

---

## Success Metrics

### For Meetup (November 29)
- [ ] Working web interface accessible in browser
- [ ] Attendees can interact with UI
- [ ] Demonstrates Project Planton's capabilities
- [ ] Visual appeal and polish
- [ ] Clear value proposition

### For Production (Long-term)
- [ ] Full backend persistence
- [ ] CLI integration complete
- [ ] Multi-user support
- [ ] Authentication/authorization
- [ ] Real deployment capability
- [ ] Production deployment

---

## Resource Allocation

**Frontend Work:** ~12-16 hours
- UI components and layouts
- Mock data integration
- Visual design and polish
- Connect-RPC client integration

**Backend Work:** ~10-14 hours
- Database setup and schema
- Service implementation
- CLI integration
- Testing

**Integration Work:** ~6-8 hours
- Frontend ↔ Backend connection
- Docker setup
- Testing and debugging
- Documentation

**Total Estimated:** ~30-40 hours of work
**Available:** ~48 hours until meetup (with parallel work)

**Realistic Assessment**: Can deliver frontend + partial backend by meetup. Full integration shortly after.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Backend not ready for meetup
**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Low (frontend with mocks still works)  
**Mitigation:** Frontend-first approach ensures demo works regardless

### Risk: Integration issues at the last minute
**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** Frontend can run standalone with mocks, integrate post-meetup

### Risk: Database schema changes during development
**Probability:** High  
**Impact:** Low  
**Mitigation:** MongoDB flexibility, start simple

### Risk: Connect-RPC learning curve
**Probability:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** Excellent docs, simpler than gRPC-web setup

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (once plan approved):**

1. **Start Frontend Setup** (parallel workstream)
   - Initialize Next.js project
   - Set up TailwindCSS
   - Create project structure

2. **Start Backend Setup** (parallel workstream)
   - Initialize Go module
   - Set up Protocol Buffers
   - Configure Connect-RPC

3. **Define Proto APIs** (required by both)
   - Core message types
   - Service definitions
   - Generate code for both sides

4. **Create Mock Data** (unblocks frontend)
   - Realistic deployment components
   - Sample cloud resources
   - Mock stack-updates

5. **Build UI Components** (main frontend work)
   - Layout and navigation
   - Component catalog
   - Resource management views

## Dependencies Between Tasks

```
Proto Definitions (1.2)
    ↓
    ├─→ Frontend Setup (1.1) → Mock Data (1.3) → UI Components (1.4)
    └─→ Backend Setup (1.1) → Database (2.1) → Services (2.2) → CLI Integration (2.3)
                                                      ↓
                                                Integration (3.1) → Docker (3.2) → Testing (3.3)
```

**Critical Path**: Proto Definitions → Mock Data → UI Components (for demo)

**Parallel Tracks**: Frontend and backend can work independently after proto definitions.
