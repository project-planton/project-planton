# T11: GCP Credential File Upload, Secret Display, and Code Cleanup

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Type:** Feature, Enhancement, Refactoring, Cleanup
**Changelog:** `2025-12-16-100607-gcp-credential-file-upload-secret-display-and-deployment-component-cleanup.md`

---

## Overview

Implemented reusable frontend components for GCP credential file upload with base64 encoding and secure secret property display. Enhanced backend GCP credential handling with proper validation. Fixed CLI display labels. Removed unused deployment component code across the codebase. All changes improve credential management UX and codebase maintainability.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Base64 File Upload Component

Created reusable file upload component for GCP service account keys:

- **Automatic base64 encoding** of uploaded JSON files
- **File validation** (size, extension)
- **Clear file functionality** with visual feedback
- **Download existing files** in view/edit mode
- **React Hook Form integration** for seamless form handling
- **JSON file download** with proper formatting

**Key Features:**
- `useBase64FileUpload` hook for form integration
- `FileUploadWithClear` component for UI display
- Supports both create and edit modes
- Handles decoded JSON from backend

### 2. Secret Property Display Component

Created secure secret display component with masking and download:

- **Show/hide toggle** for secret values
- **Modal view** for long secrets
- **JSON formatting** for structured secrets
- **Download as JSON file** functionality
- **Copy to clipboard** support
- **Automatic base64 decoding** when needed
- **Inline visibility** for short secrets

**Key Features:**
- `SecretProperty` component for displaying sensitive data
- `SecretModal` for viewing full secret values
- Supports both base64-encoded and decoded JSON
- Download with proper file naming

### 3. Backend GCP Credential Improvements

Enhanced GCP credential handling in backend service:

- **Fixed base64 validation** in create and update operations
- **Improved error messages** for invalid base64 or JSON
- **Consistent response format** (returns decoded JSON string)
- **Proper validation flow**: base64 → decode → validate JSON → store base64 → return decoded JSON

**Improvements:**
- Validates base64 encoding before storing
- Validates decoded content is valid JSON
- Returns decoded JSON string to frontend (not base64)
- Consistent behavior across all operations

### 4. CLI Display Label Fix

Fixed misleading CLI output:

- Changed label from "Service Account Key (Base64)" to "Service Account Key (JSON)"
- Added comment explaining field contains decoded JSON string
- Accurate representation of backend response

### 5. Deployment Component Code Cleanup

Removed unused deployment component code:

- **Deleted repository** (`deployment_component_repo.go` - 61 lines)
- **Deleted service** (`deployment_component_service.go` - 79 lines)
- **Deleted model** (`deployment_component.go` - 21 lines)
- **Deleted CLI command** (`list_deployment_component.go` - 19 lines)
- **Removed command registration** from root.go
- **Removed collection initialization** from mongo-init.js

**Impact:**
- Removed 180+ lines of unused code
- Cleaner codebase
- Reduced maintenance burden

### 6. Frontend Integration

Integrated new components into credential management:

- **GCP form** uses file upload component
- **Credential list** uses secret property component
- **Credential drawer** updated for new components
- **Utils library** extended with base64 file reading

## Technical Implementation

### File Upload Component Flow

```
User selects file
    ↓
Component validates (size, extension)
    ↓
Read file as base64
    ↓
Set form value with base64 string
    ↓
Backend receives base64 → validates → stores
    ↓
Backend returns decoded JSON
    ↓
Component can download as JSON file
```

### Secret Property Component Flow

```
Component receives credential ID
    ↓
User clicks show/hide button
    ↓
Fetch credential from backend
    ↓
Backend returns decoded JSON
    ↓
Display in modal or inline
    ↓
User can download as JSON file
```

### Backend GCP Credential Flow

```
Frontend: JSON file → base64 encode → send to backend
    ↓
Backend: Validate base64 → decode → validate JSON
    ↓
Backend: Store base64 in database
    ↓
Backend: Return decoded JSON string
    ↓
Frontend: Display decoded JSON (can download)
```
