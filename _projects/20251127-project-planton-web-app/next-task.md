## 📊 Project Overview

**Goal:** Transform Project Planton from CLI-only to full-stack web application

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Connect-RPC
- Backend: Golang + Connect-RPC
- Database: MongoDB

**Timeline:**
- **2 days:** Working demo for meetup
- **Long-term:** Production-ready platform

**Strategy:**
- Frontend-first with mock data
- Backend requirements emerge naturally
- Full integration follows

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**DO NOT proceed with execution until plan is approved.**

The Next Project Framework requires explicit approval before implementation begins. This ensures we're aligned on the approach before investing time in development.
