# Project Planton Web App

**Status:** 🚧 In Development
**Started:** November 27, 2025
**First Milestone:** November 29, 2025 (CNCF Hyderabad Meetup)
**Type:** Long-term Feature Development

---

## TL;DR

Building a comprehensive full-stack web application for Project Planton to transform the CLI-only tool into a production-ready product with web interface, backend API layer, and persistent database storage. First working version targeted for CNCF Hyderabad meetup in 2 days, but this is a long-term project that will evolve with the product.

---

## Project Description

Building a comprehensive full-stack web application for Project Planton with frontend UI, backend API layer, and database integration to transform the CLI-only tool into a production-ready product with persistence.

Currently, Project Planton exists as a CLI tool without backend integration or persistence capabilities. All operations are ephemeral and CLI-driven. This project will add:

1. **Web frontend** - Intuitive UI exposing all CLI capabilities
2. **Backend services** - API layer with persistence
3. **Database integration** - Persistent storage for all operations
4. **CLI integration** - Connect existing CLI to backend

---

## Primary Goal

Transform Planton from a CLI-only tool into a self-contained, production-ready product with a complete web interface, backend API layer, and persistent database storage that users will find immediately useful and want to try out.

---

## Timeline

### Immediate Milestone (November 29, 2025)
- **2 days from now**: CNCF Hyderabad meetup demo
- **Target**: Working web interface that demonstrates value
- **Approach**: Frontend with mock data if needed, backend in progress

### Long-Term Vision
- This is NOT a one-off demo project
- Architecture designed for production use
- Will evolve with Project Planton for its lifetime
- Meetup is first milestone, not final delivery

---

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript/React
- **API Client**: Connect-RPC (TypeScript client)
- **State Management**: React hooks + Context
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (following modern patterns)

### Backend
- **Language**: Golang
- **RPC Framework**: Connect-RPC (Buf Connect)
- **Why Connect-RPC**: Avoids gRPC-web complexity (no Envoy/Istio needed)
- **API Definitions**: Protocol Buffers

### Database
- **Primary**: MongoDB
- **Schema**: To be designed based on CLI operations
- **Driver**: Official MongoDB Go driver

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (for production)
- **Local Dev**: Docker Compose

---

## Project Type

**Feature Development** - Building major new capabilities across multiple components.

---

## Affected Components

1. **Project Planton CLI** (existing Go codebase)
   - Integration with backend
   - Add persistence layer
   - Maintain CLI usability

2. **New Web Frontend** (Next.js application)
   - User interface for all CLI operations
   - List views and data visualization
   - Resource creation and management

3. **New Backend Services** (Golang + Connect-RPC)
   - RPC-based APIs
   - Business logic layer
   - Data persistence operations

4. **New Database Layer** (MongoDB)
   - Schema design
   - Data models
   - Query patterns

5. **Integration Layer**
   - CLI ↔ Backend
   - Frontend ↔ Backend
   - Shared data models (Protocol Buffers)

---

## Success Criteria

### For Meetup Milestone (November 29, 2025)
- ✅ Working web interface accessible in browser
- ✅ Clear demonstration of Project Planton's value
- ✅ Something attendees can interact with and try
- ✅ Visual representation of deployment components
- ✅ Mock data acceptable if backend not fully ready

### For Long-Term Production Readiness
- ✅ Full backend persistence (all operations stored)
- ✅ CLI integration with backend
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization
- ✅ Authentication and authorization
- ✅ Multi-user support
- ✅ Production deployment capability
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

---

## Technical Architecture

### Three-Phase Development Strategy

#### Phase 1: Frontend with Mock Data (Parallel Work)
**Goal**: Don't wait for backend - build UI with dummy data

**Deliverables**:
- Complete web interface with all views
- Mock data representing deployment components
- User interaction flows
- Component designs and layouts

**Benefit**: Frontend work proceeds independently, reveals exact backend requirements

#### Phase 2: Backend Requirements Identification
**Goal**: Define precise backend APIs needed

**Approach**:
- Document all RPC calls frontend needs
- Use CLI operations as blueprint
- Map CLI functionality to backend APIs
- Define data models and schemas

**Output**: Clear specification for backend implementation

#### Phase 3: Backend and Database Implementation
**Goal**: Build real backend with persistence

**Deliverables**:
- Backend RPC services (Connect-RPC)
- MongoDB schemas and collections
- CLI integration with backend
- Frontend connection to real APIs

**Result**: Fully integrated system with persistence

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Connect-RPC Over gRPC?

**Problem with gRPC-web**:
- Requires Envoy proxy or Istio service mesh
- Additional infrastructure complexity
- Harder to deploy and maintain

**Connect-RPC Benefits**:
- Works directly over HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
- No proxy required
- Browser-compatible out of the box
- Same Protocol Buffers definitions
- Simpler deployment

### Why MongoDB?

**Alignment with Planton Cloud**:
- Same database as Planton Cloud InfraHub
- Proven patterns available
- Flexible schema for cloud resources
- Good query performance

**Development Benefits**:
- Schema flexibility during early iterations
- Easy to add fields
- Natural fit for nested resource structures

### Why Mock-First Frontend?

**Speed**:
- Frontend development can start immediately
- No waiting for backend to be ready

**Requirements Discovery**:
- Building UI reveals what backend needs to do
- Prevents over-engineering backend
- Frontend team defines API contract

**Demo Capability**:
- Working UI can demo even without backend
- Visual progress for stakeholders
- Easier to iterate on UX

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- Protocol Buffers (buf CLI)
- Connect-RPC code generation
- MongoDB instance (local + production)
- Next.js and Go toolchains

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing Project Planton CLI codebase
- CloudResourceKind enum and definitions
- Deployment component schemas
- Validation rules from proto definitions

### Timeline Constraint
- **2 days to meetup**: Aggressive timeline
- **Mitigation**: Mock-first approach ensures something to show
- **Realistic**: Full integration may take longer, but demo will work

### Integration Complexity
- Three major components must work together
- Data models must align across CLI, backend, frontend
- Protocol Buffers provide type safety across boundaries

---

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Cannot finish backend in 2 days

**Mitigation**:
- Frontend with mock data is still valuable demo
- Shows vision and capability
- Backend can be finished post-meetup

### Risk: Three components difficult to integrate

**Mitigation**:
- Protocol Buffers provide shared type system
- Connect-RPC simplifies RPC layer
- Start with small end-to-end slice

### Risk: CLI integration changes break existing functionality

**Mitigation**:
- CLI continues to work standalone
- Backend is additive, not replacement
- Comprehensive testing before merging

### Risk: Database schema changes during development

**Mitigation**:
- MongoDB schema flexibility
- Start simple, iterate
- Version migrations if needed
