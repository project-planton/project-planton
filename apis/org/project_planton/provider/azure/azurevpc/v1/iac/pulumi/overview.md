# Overview

The provided Pulumi module is designed to manage the lifecycle of an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) through our Unified APIs that mimic Kubernetes' resource modeling. The module accepts an `AzureVpcStackInput`, which includes the Pulumi input configurations, the target Azure VPC resource, and Azure credentials. Specifically, it utilizes the Azure credentials from the `stackInput` to instantiate an Azure provider within the Pulumi context. This setup allows the module to securely interact with Azure resources using the provided `ClientId`, `ClientSecret`, `SubscriptionId`, and `TenantId`.

By initializing the Azure provider with these credentials, the module prepares the environment for deploying and managing the Virtual Network infrastructure as defined in the `api-resource.yaml` file. The module provisions a complete networking stack including a Resource Group, Virtual Network, subnet for AKS nodes or other workloads, optional NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity, and optional Private DNS zone links for name resolution.

This Pulumi module exemplifies the standardized structure of our APIs and demonstrates how developers can deploy complex network infrastructure using a single YAML configuration, benefiting from consistent documentation available via buf.build. The module follows Azure networking best practices, including proper address space planning, subnet segmentation, and scalable outbound connectivity patterns.
