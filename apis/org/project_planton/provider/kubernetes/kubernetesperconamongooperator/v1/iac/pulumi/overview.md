# Overview

The Percona Operator for MongoDB Kubernetes Pulumi module is engineered to streamline the deployment of the Percona Server for MongoDB (PSMDB) operator within Kubernetes environments. By adhering to a standardized API resource structure, the module accepts a `KubernetesPerconaMongoOperatorStackInput` specification, which encompasses essential configurations such as target cluster credentials, namespace settings, and container resource allocations. Upon execution, the module initializes necessary local variables including Helm chart configurations and establishes a Kubernetes provider using the provided cluster credentials. It then proceeds to create a dedicated Kubernetes namespace for the operator, ensuring proper isolation and organization of the deployed resources. The module leverages the official Percona Helm chart repository to install the PSMDB operator, configuring it with the specified container resources and enabling cluster-wide monitoring of MongoDB deployments.

Beyond deployment, the module captures and exports critical output parameters that facilitate seamless integration and operational management. These outputs include the namespace name where the operator is installed, enabling users to easily reference and interact with the deployed operator. The module configures the operator with best practices in mind, including cluster-wide namespace watching capabilities, atomic deployments for reliability, and automatic cleanup on failure to maintain cluster hygiene. By encapsulating the deployment logic within this Pulumi module, platform teams can declaratively manage and deploy the Percona MongoDB operator infrastructure across various Kubernetes clusters with ease and consistency. This powerful pattern not only simplifies the infrastructure provisioning process but also ensures scalability, maintainability, and adherence to production-grade operational standards for running stateful MongoDB workloads in Kubernetes environments.
