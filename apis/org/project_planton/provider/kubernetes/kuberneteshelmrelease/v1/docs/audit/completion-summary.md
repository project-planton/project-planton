## Overview

The KubernetesHelmRelease component has been completed from 97% to **100%** by addressing all minor polish items identified in the audit report.

## Completed Items

**Before:**
```go
package module

const (
	OpNamespace = "namespace"
)
```

**After:**

- Detailed comments for `OpNamespace` including:
  - What it represents (Kubernetes namespace for Helm release)
  - How to use it (`pulumi stack output namespace`)
  - Priority order for namespace determination (3 levels)
- Future-proofing with commented potential outputs:
  - release_name, chart_name, chart_version
  - chart_repo, release_status, release_revision
  - manifest rendering

### 2. Enhanced examples.md ✅

**File:** `examples.md`

**Impact:** +1.16%

**Improvements:**
- Expanded from 1.9KB to 10KB+ (5x increase in content)

- New advanced examples added:
  1. Production PostgreSQL with replication
  2. Monitoring stack with Prometheus
  3. Private Helm repository with authentication
  4. OCI registry Helm chart deployment
  5. Multi-environment configurations (dev and prod)

**Additional Content:**

- Ingress and TLS setup

### 3. Created iac/tf/examples.md ✅

**File:** `iac/tf/examples.md`

**Impact:** +5.00%

**Content (7KB+):**
Created comprehensive Terraform-specific examples including:

**6 Main Examples:**
1. Basic Usage - Simple NGINX deployment
2. Helm Release with Custom Values - HA configuration
3. WordPress with Ingress - Public-facing website
4. Production PostgreSQL - Database with replication
5. Multi-Environment Setup - Using Terraform workspaces
6. Using Terraform Variables - Parameterized deployments

**Advanced Topics:**
- Working with Complex Helm Values (nested, arrays, YAML blocks)
- Managing Secrets (sensitive variables, external secrets)
- Outputs and Dependencies (module chaining)
- Best Practices for Terraform deployments

**Terraform-Specific Guidance:**
- Dot notation for nested Helm values
- String requirements for all values
- Using Terraform variables and locals
- Workspace management
- Remote state backends
- Module versioning

**Practical Sections:**
- Common Terraform commands reference

### 4. Moved manifest.yaml to Standard Location ✅

**Impact:** +0.83%

**Changes:**
- **From:** `iac/tf/hack/manifest.yaml` (non-standard location)
- **To:** `iac/hack/manifest.yaml` (standard location across components)
- **Benefit:** Consistency with component architecture guidelines

**Updates Made:**
- Created `iac/hack/` directory
- Moved manifest file
- Removed now-empty `iac/tf/hack/` directory
- Updated `iac/tf/README.md` to reference correct path (`../hack/manifest.yaml`)
- Enhanced Terraform README with better documentation
