# OpenFGA Provider Configuration
#
# The OpenFGA provider credentials are passed via environment variables:
# - FGA_API_URL (required): The OpenFGA server URL
# - FGA_API_TOKEN: For token-based authentication
# - FGA_CLIENT_ID, FGA_CLIENT_SECRET, FGA_API_TOKEN_ISSUER: For client credentials auth
#
# These environment variables are automatically configured by Project Planton
# from the OpenFgaProviderConfig in the stack input.
#
# Reference: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/openfga/openfga/latest/docs
