# OpenFGA Store - Pulumi Module

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: OpenFGA does not have a Pulumi provider. This module is a **pass-through placeholder** that does not create any resources.

## Use Terraform Instead

To deploy OpenFGA resources, you **must** use Terraform/Tofu as the provisioner:

```bash
project-planton apply --manifest openfga-store.yaml \
  --openfga-provider-config openfga-creds.yaml \
  --provisioner tofu
```

## Why This Module Exists

This module exists only to maintain consistency with the Project Planton deployment component structure. All deployment components have both Pulumi and Terraform modules, but OpenFGA only has a Terraform provider.

When this module is executed:
1. It logs a warning that no Pulumi provider is available
2. It exports a notice indicating no resources were created
3. It exits successfully without creating any infrastructure
