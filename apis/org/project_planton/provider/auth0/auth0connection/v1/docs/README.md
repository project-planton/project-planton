# Auth0Connection: Technical Research Documentation

## Introduction

Auth0 is a leading identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) platform that provides authentication, authorization, and user management capabilities. At the core of Auth0's architecture are **connections** - the bridges between applications and identity sources.

This document provides comprehensive research into Auth0 connections, their configuration landscape, and the rationale behind Project Planton's Auth0Connection deployment component design.

## The Evolution of Identity Management

### From Custom Authentication to Identity Platforms

The authentication landscape has evolved significantly:

1. **Custom Database Authentication (1990s-2000s)**
   - Applications built their own user databases
   - Password hashing, session management, security all custom-built
   - High security burden on developers

2. **OAuth/OpenID Connect Era (2010s)**
   - Standardized protocols for delegated authentication
   - "Login with Google/Facebook" became ubiquitous
   - Still required significant integration work

3. **Identity-as-a-Service (2015-present)**
   - Auth0, Okta, Firebase Auth abstract complexity
   - Unified APIs for multiple identity sources
   - Built-in security best practices

### Why Auth0 Connections Matter

Connections in Auth0 serve as:
- **Abstraction Layer**: Unified API regardless of identity source
- **Security Boundary**: Consistent security policies across providers
- **Integration Point**: Single configuration for multiple applications
- **Compliance Enabler**: Audit trails and policy enforcement

## Auth0 Connection Types

### 1. Database Connections

Auth0's hosted user database (strategy: `auth0`) provides:

**Features:**
- Secure password storage (bcrypt hashing)
- Configurable password policies
- Brute force protection
- Password history enforcement
- User metadata storage

**Use Cases:**
- Consumer applications requiring email/password signup
- Applications needing full user profile control
- Scenarios where social login isn't appropriate

**Configuration Complexity:**
- Password policy selection (none → excellent)
- Username requirements
- MFA enforcement
- Custom database scripts (advanced)

### 2. Social Connections

Social identity providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) enable:

**Features:**
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect integration
- Automatic profile population
- Reduced signup friction
- Trust in established providers

**Supported Providers:**
| Provider | Strategy | Primary Scopes |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Google | `google-oauth2` | openid, profile, email |
| Facebook | `facebook` | email, public_profile |
| GitHub | `github` | read:user, user:email |
| LinkedIn | `linkedin` | r_liteprofile, r_emailaddress |
| Twitter | `twitter` | - |
| Microsoft | `microsoft-account` | openid, profile, email |
| Apple | `apple` | name, email |

**Configuration Requirements:**
- OAuth app credentials from provider
- Scope selection based on data needs
- Callback URL configuration

### 3. Enterprise Connections

Enterprise identity providers enable Single Sign-On (SSO):

**SAML (strategy: `samlp`):**
- Industry standard for enterprise SSO
- Supports Okta, OneLogin, ADFS, PingFederate
- XML-based protocol
- Requires certificate management

**OpenID Connect (strategy: `oidc`):**
- Modern alternative to SAML
- JSON/REST-based
- Supports Keycloak, Ping Identity, custom providers
- Dynamic discovery via `.well-known/openid-configuration`

**Azure AD / Entra ID (strategy: `waad`):**
- Native Microsoft integration
- Group synchronization
- Directory API access
- Multi-tenant support

**Active Directory (strategy: `ad`):**
- On-premises AD integration
- Requires AD/LDAP Connector
- Kerberos/NTLM support

## Deployment Methods: Landscape Analysis

### Manual Configuration (Auth0 Dashboard)

**Pros:**
- Visual interface
- Immediate feedback
- Good for exploration

**Cons:**
- No version control
- Manual reproduction across environments
- Prone to configuration drift
- Not auditable

### Auth0 Deploy CLI

Auth0's official configuration-as-code tool:

**Pros:**
- YAML/JSON configuration files
- CI/CD integration
- Environment-specific overrides

**Cons:**
- Auth0-specific tooling
- Learning curve for syntax
- Limited cross-platform integration

### Terraform

HashiCorp's infrastructure-as-code approach:

**Pros:**
- Industry standard IaC
- State management
- Plan/apply workflow
- Large community

**Cons:**
- Requires Terraform expertise
- State file management complexity
- HCL learning curve

**Auth0 Provider Resources:**
- `auth0_connection` - Connection configuration
- `auth0_connection_client` - Client enablement
- `auth0_connection_scim_configuration` - SCIM setup

### Pulumi

Programming language-based IaC:

**Pros:**
- Full programming language (Go, Python, TypeScript)
- Type safety
- IDE support
- Reusable components

**Cons:**
- Requires programming knowledge
- Less declarative than Terraform
- Smaller community for Auth0

**Auth0 Provider:**
- `auth0.Connection` - Connection resource
- Full TypeScript/Go type definitions

## Project Planton's Approach

### 80/20 Scoping Decision

Based on research, the following features cover 80% of use cases:

**In Scope:**
1. **Database connections** with password policies
2. **Major social providers** (Google, Facebook, GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Microsoft, Apple)
3. **Enterprise SSO** via SAML, OIDC, and Azure AD
4. **Security controls** (brute force, password history, MFA)
5. **Client enablement** and realm configuration
6. **Domain-based discovery** for enterprise SSO

**Out of Scope (20% edge cases):**
1. Custom database action scripts
2. Passwordless connections (SMS, email link)
3. Active Directory connector configuration
4. Connection-level rate limiting
5. Custom social providers
6. SCIM provisioning configuration

**Rationale:**
- Custom scripts require runtime environment (Lambda, etc.)
- Passwordless requires additional infrastructure (Twilio, SendGrid)
- AD connector is infrastructure, not just configuration
- Rate limiting is rarely customized per-connection
- Custom social providers are rare

### Design Decisions

#### 1. Strategy-Specific Options

Rather than a flat structure with all possible fields, we use strategy-specific option blocks:
- `database_options` for auth0 strategy
- `social_options` for social strategies
- `saml_options` for samlp strategy
- `oidc_options` for oidc strategy
- `azure_ad_options` for waad strategy

**Rationale:** Prevents confusion about which fields apply to which strategy.

#### 2. Sensible Defaults

All optional fields have production-appropriate defaults:
- `password_policy: "good"` (not "none")
- `brute_force_protection: true`
- `password_dictionary: true`

**Rationale:** Secure by default; users opt-out of security, not opt-in.

#### 3. Validation Rules

Proto validations enforce:
- Required strategy field with allowed values
- Required credentials for each strategy type
- Numeric ranges (password_history_size: 0-24)
- Enum values for password policies, signature algorithms

**Rationale:** Fail fast at manifest validation, not at deployment time.

## Implementation Landscape

### Terraform Implementation

The Terraform module uses:
- `auth0_connection` resource
- Dynamic blocks for strategy-specific options
- Local values for computed configuration
- Conditional resource arguments based on strategy

### Pulumi Implementation

The Pulumi module uses:
- `auth0.Connection` resource
- Go struct for locals
- Strategy switch for option building
- Type-safe configuration

### Feature Parity

Both implementations support identical features:
- All connection strategies
- All option configurations
- All output values

## Production Best Practices

### Security

1. **Password Policies**: Use "good" or "excellent" for production
2. **Brute Force**: Always enable brute force protection
3. **MFA**: Consider MFA for high-security applications
4. **Password History**: Prevent password reuse (5-10 entries)

### Operations

1. **Client Scoping**: Only enable connections for applications that need them
2. **Environment Separation**: Different connections per environment when needed
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor connection usage and failures via Auth0 logs
4. **Rotation**: Regularly rotate OAuth client secrets

### Enterprise SSO

1. **Certificate Management**: Track certificate expiration for SAML
2. **Domain Verification**: Verify domains before enabling domain connections
3. **Group Mapping**: Map IdP groups to Auth0 roles/permissions
4. **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Understand JIT provisioning implications

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Missing Client Enablement

Creating a connection without enabling it for any clients results in an unusable connection. Always specify `enabled_clients`.

### 2. Incorrect OAuth Callback URLs

Social and enterprise connections require correct callback URLs registered with the identity provider. Auth0's callback URL format: `https://{tenant}.auth0.com/login/callback`

### 3. Certificate Expiration

SAML certificates expire and must be rotated. Monitor expiration dates.

### 4. Scope Creep

Requesting too many scopes from social providers can trigger additional review processes (Facebook, Google).

### 5. Multi-Tenant Confusion

For Azure AD, misunderstanding `use_common_endpoint` vs tenant-specific configuration leads to authentication failures.

## Conclusion

Auth0 connections are the fundamental building blocks of identity integration. Project Planton's Auth0Connection component provides a declarative, secure-by-default approach to managing these connections across multiple strategies.

By focusing on the 80% use case while providing comprehensive options for common scenarios, this component enables teams to:
- Standardize authentication configuration
- Version control identity infrastructure
- Maintain consistency across environments
- Apply security best practices automatically

The dual IaC implementation (Pulumi and Terraform) ensures flexibility in deployment tooling while the KRM-style manifest provides a familiar, declarative interface for platform engineers.
