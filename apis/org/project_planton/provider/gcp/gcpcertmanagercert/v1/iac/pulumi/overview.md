# Pulumi Module Overview

The `GcpCertManagerCert` Pulumi module provides an intelligent abstraction for provisioning SSL/TLS certificates on Google Cloud Platform. It bridges two distinct GCP certificate services—the modern **Certificate Manager** and the classic **Google-managed SSL certificates**—through a unified API, enabling developers to choose between cost optimization and advanced features without managing the underlying complexity.

By accepting a single declarative specification, the module automatically orchestrates multi-step DNS validation workflows, creates DNS authorization records in Cloud DNS, and provisions certificates in the appropriate GCP service based on requirements. This transforms what would typically require 3-5 separate resources and explicit dependency management into a single, atomic operation.

## Key Capabilities

### Dual Certificate Type Support

The module intelligently provisions certificates based on the `certificate_type` field:

- **MANAGED (default)**: Creates certificates using Google Certificate Manager, supporting wildcard domains, DNS-based validation, regional scoping, and certificate maps for scale
- **LOAD_BALANCER**: Creates classic Google-managed SSL certificates optimized for load balancers, offering zero-cost provisioning but limited to non-wildcard, global certificates

This dual-mode design allows cost optimization for simple use cases (free classic certificates) while providing production-grade features (Certificate Manager) when needed.

### Automated DNS Validation Orchestration

For `MANAGED` certificates, the module automates the complex DNS validation workflow:

1. **DNS Authorization Creation**: Creates a `google_certificate_manager_dns_authorization` resource for each domain
2. **CNAME Record Extraction**: Extracts the unique CNAME validation record from the authorization response
3. **DNS Record Provisioning**: Creates the CNAME record in the specified Cloud DNS zone
4. **Dependency Management**: Ensures DNS records exist before certificate creation using explicit `DependsOn` relationships
5. **Certificate Provisioning**: Creates the certificate with proper references to all DNS authorizations

This orchestration eliminates the "chicken-and-egg" validation problem and enables **zero-downtime certificate provisioning** independent of load balancer availability.

### Multi-Domain Certificate Support

The module supports both single-domain and multi-domain (Subject Alternative Names) certificates:

- Primary domain (`primary_domain_name`) serves as the main certificate identity
- Alternate domains (`alternate_domain_names`) are added as SANs
- Wildcard domains (`*.example.com`) are fully supported with Certificate Manager
- All domains are validated through a unified DNS authorization workflow

## Module Architecture

### Entry Point: `Resources` Function

The `Resources` function (`main.go`) serves as the module's entry point, following ProjectPlanton's standard pattern:

```go
func Resources(ctx *pulumi.Context, stackInput *gcpcertv1.GcpCertManagerCertStackInput) error
```

**Workflow:**
1. Initializes local variables from stack input (`initializeLocals`)
2. Configures the GCP provider with credentials from stack input
3. Invokes the certificate provisioning logic (`certManagerCert`)
4. Returns any errors with wrapped context for debugging

### Core Logic: `certManagerCert` Function

The `certManagerCert` function (`cert_manager_cert.go`) implements the certificate provisioning logic:

**Decision Logic:**
1. Reads the `certificate_type` from the spec (defaults to `MANAGED`)
2. Aggregates all domains (primary + alternates) into a single list
3. Routes to the appropriate provisioning function based on type:
   - `createManagedCertificate` for Certificate Manager certificates
   - `createLoadBalancerCertificate` for classic Google-managed SSL certificates

### Certificate Manager Implementation: `createManagedCertificate`

This function provisions modern Certificate Manager certificates with DNS validation:

**Resource Creation Sequence:**
1. **For each domain**:
   - Create a `certificatemanager.DnsAuthorization` with unique name and labels
   - Extract the DNS validation record (name, type, data) from the authorization
   - Create a `dns.RecordSet` in Cloud DNS with the CNAME validation record
   
2. **Certificate provisioning**:
   - Create a `certificatemanager.Certificate` with all domains
   - Reference all DNS authorizations for validation
   - Apply explicit `DependsOn` to ensure DNS records exist before certificate creation
   
3. **Output exports**:
   - `certificate-id`: The GCP resource ID
   - `certificate-name`: The certificate name
   - `certificate-domain-name`: The primary domain
   - `certificate-status`: Current provisioning status

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Uses `ApplyT` transforms to safely extract DNS record data from authorization outputs
- Iterates over all domains to create separate DNS authorizations per domain
- Aggregates all authorization IDs into a single array for certificate reference
- Applies GCP labels for resource management and cost attribution

### Load Balancer Implementation: `createLoadBalancerCertificate`

This function provisions classic Google-managed SSL certificates:

**Resource Creation:**
- Creates a `compute.ManagedSslCertificate` with all domains
- Validation happens automatically when the certificate is attached to a load balancer
- No DNS records are created (load balancer-based validation)

**Limitations:**
- Does not support wildcard domains
- Global scope only (no regional certificates)
- Validation requires active load balancer with correct DNS routing

### Local Variables: `initializeLocals`

The `initializeLocals` function (`locals.go`) prepares local variables used throughout the module:

**GCP Labels:**
- Constructs standardized GCP labels from metadata:
  - `resource`: Always `true` (marks as ProjectPlanton-managed)
  - `resource-name`: The certificate name
  - `resource-kind`: `gcpcertmanagercert`
  - `resource-id`: The ProjectPlanton resource ID
  - `organization`: The organization ID
  - `environment`: The environment name

These labels enable consistent resource management, cost tracking, and compliance across all ProjectPlanton-managed resources.

## Resource Dependencies

The module manages complex resource dependencies to ensure correct provisioning order:

```
DNS Authorization (per domain)
         ↓
    DNS Record (CNAME validation)
         ↓
    Certificate (aggregates all authorizations)
```

Pulumi's automatic dependency tracking handles most relationships, but the module explicitly declares `DependsOn` for the certificate → DNS authorizations relationship to prevent race conditions.

## Outputs and Status Tracking

The module exports outputs to the Pulumi stack for integration with other infrastructure:

| Output | Description | Example Value |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| `certificate-id` | GCP resource ID | `projects/.../certificates/my-cert` |
| `certificate-name` | Certificate name | `my-cert` |
| `certificate-domain-name` | Primary domain | `example.com` |
| `certificate-status` | Provisioning status | `PROVISIONING` or `ACTIVE` |

These outputs are mapped to the `stack_outputs.proto` structure and returned to the ProjectPlanton CLI for status reporting and integration with other resources.

## Error Handling

The module employs defensive error handling throughout:

- **Provider setup errors**: Wrapped with context about provider configuration
- **DNS authorization errors**: Wrapped with the specific domain that failed
- **DNS record errors**: Wrapped with domain and zone information
- **Certificate creation errors**: Wrapped with certificate type and domain list

All errors are returned with descriptive messages to aid troubleshooting and debugging.

## Integration with ProjectPlanton Ecosystem

The Pulumi module integrates seamlessly with ProjectPlanton's multi-cloud framework:

- **Stack Input**: Receives `GcpCertManagerCertStackInput` containing the resource definition and provider credentials
- **Protobuf Validation**: All input is validated against Protobuf schema before module execution
- **Standard Metadata**: Uses shared metadata structure (name, ID, org, env) for consistent resource management
- **Foreign Key Resolution**: Resolves Cloud DNS zone references through ProjectPlanton's foreign key system
- **Output Mapping**: Exports outputs in a structure that maps to `stack_outputs.proto` for CLI integration

## Production Considerations

### DNS Propagation

Certificate Manager validation requires DNS records to be globally propagated. The module creates DNS records synchronously, but validation may take 5-10 minutes depending on DNS TTL and global propagation time.

### Certificate Lifecycle

All Google-managed certificates (both types) are **automatically renewed** by GCP before expiration. No user intervention is required for renewal.

### Scale Limits

- **Classic certificates**: Maximum 15 per target proxy
- **Certificate Manager (direct attachment)**: Maximum 100 per proxy
- **Certificate Manager (with maps)**: Thousands of certificates per map

For deployments requiring more than 10-15 certificates, use Certificate Manager (`MANAGED` type) to future-proof against scale limits.

### Cost Optimization

The module defaults to `MANAGED` (Certificate Manager) for maximum features, but allows explicit selection of `LOAD_BALANCER` for cost-sensitive deployments that don't require wildcard support or advanced features.
