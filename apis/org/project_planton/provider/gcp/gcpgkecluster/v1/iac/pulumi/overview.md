The `GcpGkeCluster` component in ProjectPlanton streamlines the provisioning of production-ready Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) control planes. With a single YAML manifest, you can define essential cluster configurations such as VPC networking, private cluster settings, Workload Identity, network policies, and auto-upgrade strategies. This opinionated approach uses Protobuf-based validations to enforce security best practices and catch misconfigurations early, translating seamlessly to either Pulumi or Terraform under the hood.

By consolidating GKE cluster configuration into one resource, `GcpGkeCluster` ensures consistent, secure deployments across environments. The component enforces private-by-default architecture with VPC-native networking, separates control plane from node pools for lifecycle independence, and enables Workload Identity and network policies for production security. Whether you're deploying regional clusters for high availability or zonal clusters for development, this component reduces complexity, promotes best practices, and integrates naturally into the larger ProjectPlanton multi-cloud ecosystem.

The Pulumi implementation in Go leverages the `pulumi-gcp` provider to create GKE clusters with:
- **Private cluster configuration** with optional public nodes for development
- **VPC-native networking** (IP aliasing) for modern GKE features
- **Workload Identity** for secure pod-level IAM without shared secrets
- **Network policies** (Calico) for microsegmentation
- **Release channels** for automated, controlled Kubernetes version upgrades

The module architecture follows ProjectPlanton's standard pattern: a `Resources` function receives stack input (resource definition + provider credentials), initializes local variables, sets up the GCP provider, and creates the cluster resource. Outputs include the cluster endpoint, CA certificate, and Workload Identity pool, ready for node pool provisioning and application deployment.
