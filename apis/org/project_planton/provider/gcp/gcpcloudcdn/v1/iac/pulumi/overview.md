# GCP Cloud CDN Pulumi Module

## Overview

The **GCP Cloud CDN Pulumi Module** is engineered to streamline the deployment and management of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud CDN services within a multi-cloud infrastructure. Leveraging Planton Cloud's unified API framework, this module models each API resource using a Kubernetes-like structure with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. The `GcpCloudCdn` resource encapsulates the necessary specifications for provisioning Cloud CDN configurations, enabling developers to manage their content delivery infrastructure as code with ease and consistency.

By utilizing this Pulumi module, developers can automate the creation and configuration of GCP Cloud CDN resources based on defined specifications such as project ID and credential configurations. The module seamlessly integrates with GCP credentials provided in the resource definition, ensuring secure and authenticated interactions with GCP services. Furthermore, the outputs generated from the deployment, including resource identifiers and endpoint URLs, are captured in the resource's `status.outputs`. This facilitates effective monitoring and management of Cloud CDN resources directly through the `GcpCloudCdn` resource, enhancing operational efficiency and infrastructure visibility.
