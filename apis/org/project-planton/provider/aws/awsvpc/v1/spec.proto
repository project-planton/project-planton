// availability zones, subnets, and various networking features like NAT gateways, DNS hostnames, and DNS support.
// An AWS VPC allows you to create a virtual network in the AWS cloud, where you can launch AWS resources in a
// logically isolated section with complete control over your virtual networking environment.
// With VPC, you can define your own IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables and network gateways.
// This specification helps in automating the VPC creation process with specified configurations, ensuring a consistent
