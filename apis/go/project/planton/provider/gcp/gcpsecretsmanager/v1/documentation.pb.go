//# Overview
//
//The GCP Secrets Manager API resource provides a consistent and streamlined interface for creating and managing secrets within Google Cloud Secrets Manager as part of our cloud infrastructure. By abstracting the complexities of secrets management, this resource allows you to securely store and retrieve sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets effortlessly while ensuring consistency and compliance across different environments.
//
//## Why We Created This API Resource
//
//Securely managing secrets is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of applications. Google Cloud Secrets Manager offers a robust solution, but configuring it correctly can be complex due to various options and best practices. To simplify this process and promote a standardized approach, we developed this API resource. It enables you to:
//
//- **Simplify Secret Management**: Easily create and manage secrets without dealing with low-level GCP configurations.
//- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain uniform secret management practices across different environments and applications.
//- **Enhance Security**: Securely store sensitive information with encryption and control access via IAM policies.
//- **Improve Productivity**: Reduce the time and effort required to manage secrets, allowing you to focus on application development.
//
//## Key Features
//
//### Environment Integration
//
//- **Environment Info**: Seamlessly integrates with our environment management system to manage secrets within specific environments.
//- **Stack Job Settings**: Supports custom stack job settings for infrastructure-as-code deployments.
//
//### GCP Credential Management
//
//- **GCP Credential ID**: Utilizes specified GCP credentials to ensure secure and authorized operations within Google Cloud Platform.
//
//### Customizable Secret Specifications
//
//- **Project ID**: Define the GCP project (`project_id`) where the secrets will be created, ensuring resources are organized within the correct project.
//- **Bulk Secret Creation**: Specify a list of secret names (`secret_names`) to be created in Google Cloud Secrets Manager, streamlining the process of setting up multiple secrets at once.
//
//### Secure Storage
//
//- **Encryption at Rest**: Secrets are encrypted using Google-managed encryption keys, enhancing security for sensitive data.
//- **Version Control**: Google Cloud Secrets Manager keeps track of versions for each secret, allowing for easy rotation and rollback if necessary.
//
//### Access Control
//
//- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Control access to secrets using IAM policies, ensuring that only authorized users and services can retrieve sensitive information.
//- **Integration with GCP Services**: Seamlessly integrate secrets with other GCP services like Cloud Run, GKE, and Cloud Functions for secure retrieval at runtime.
//
//## Benefits
//
//- **Enhanced Security**: Centralizes the management of secrets with robust encryption and access control mechanisms.
//- **Simplified Management**: Reduces complexity in creating and managing secrets across different environments.
//- **Consistency**: Ensures that all applications and services have access to the required secrets in a standardized manner.
//- **Compliance**: Helps in meeting regulatory requirements by securely managing sensitive information.
//- **Productivity**: Frees up development and operations teams to focus on core tasks rather than managing secrets infrastructure.
