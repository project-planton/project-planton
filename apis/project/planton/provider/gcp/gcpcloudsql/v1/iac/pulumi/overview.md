# GcpCloudSql Pulumi Module

## Overview

The **GcpCloudSql** Pulumi module is part of the Planton Cloud ecosystem, which provides a unified API interface for managing multi-cloud infrastructure. This module enables developers to create and manage Google Cloud SQL instances by using a Kubernetes-style API resource model. The module automates the provisioning of Cloud SQL databases and other related resources in Google Cloud, based on the specifications defined in a YAML configuration file. It simplifies complex infrastructure management, offering an abstraction layer that allows developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure.

The key benefit of this module is its seamless integration with the Planton CLI and the standardized API resource format used across the entire platform. It allows you to provide configurations in a declarative manner, automatically handles resource creation on Google Cloud, and captures all outputs, such as instance details, in the `status.stackOutputs`. This reduces manual intervention and the complexity involved in managing cloud resources. By using this module, you can easily deploy, configure, and manage Cloud SQL instances in a consistent and predictable way across your environments.
