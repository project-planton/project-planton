# GCP Cloud Function Module - Comprehensive Overview

## Overview

The **GCP Cloud Function Module** is part of the unified Planton Cloud API architecture, designed to simplify and standardize the deployment of cloud infrastructure across multiple cloud providers. This module takes a GCP Cloud Function API resource as input, configures the necessary cloud provider resources, and deploys a fully functional cloud function on Google Cloud. The module is written in Golang and leverages Pulumi for infrastructure management. It integrates directly with Plantonâ€™s CLI (`planton pulumi up`), allowing developers to easily deploy, manage, and configure GCP Cloud Functions through a standardized API resource model.

This module captures the output of the deployment in `status.stackOutputs`, enabling users to retrieve important information about the deployed cloud function. The key advantage of this module is its ability to handle infrastructure complexity in a simple, declarative format (YAML), following a Kubernetes-style API resource structure.
