# GCP Cloud CDN Pulumi Module

## Key Features

### API Resource Features

- **Standardized Structure**: The `GcpCloudCdn` API resource adheres to a consistent schema with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. This uniformity ensures compatibility and ease of integration within Kubernetes-like environments, promoting seamless workflow incorporation and tooling interoperability.
  
- **Configurable Specifications**:
  - **GCP Credential ID**: Securely reference the GCP credentials required to set up the Pulumi provider, ensuring authenticated and authorized interactions with GCP services.
  - **GCP Project ID**: Specify the GCP project where the Cloud CDN resources will be deployed, enabling precise management and organization of cloud resources.
  
- **Validation and Compliance**: Incorporates stringent validation rules to ensure all configurations adhere to established standards and best practices, minimizing the risk of misconfigurations and enhancing overall system reliability.

### Pulumi Module Features

- **Automated GCP Provider Setup**: Leverages the provided GCP credentials to automatically configure the Pulumi GCP provider, enabling seamless and secure interactions with GCP Cloud CDN resources.
  
- **Cloud CDN Management**: Streamlines the creation and management of GCP Cloud CDN configurations based on the provided specifications. This includes setting up CDN parameters to align with organizational requirements and performance standards.
  
- **Environment Isolation**: Manages isolated environments within GCP, ensuring resources are organized and segregated according to organizational needs, which aids in maintaining clear boundaries and reducing resource conflicts.
  
- **Exported Stack Outputs**: Captures essential outputs such as resource identifiers and endpoint URLs in `status.outputs`. These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, enabling effective monitoring, management, and automation workflows.
  
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designed to accommodate a wide range of Cloud CDN configurations, the module supports varying levels of complexity and can be easily extended to meet evolving infrastructure demands, ensuring long-term adaptability.
  
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to promptly identify and report issues encountered during deployment or configuration processes, aiding in swift troubleshooting and maintaining infrastructure integrity.

## Installation

To integrate the GCP Cloud CDN Pulumi Module into your project, retrieve it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo/gcp-cloud-cdn-pulumi-module). Ensure that you have both Pulumi and Go installed and properly configured in your development environment.

```shell

Refer to the [example section](#examples) for usage instructions.

## Module Details

### Input Configuration

The module expects a `GcpCloudCdnStackInput` which includes:

- **Pulumi Input**: Configuration details required by Pulumi for managing the stack, such as stack names, project settings, and any necessary Pulumi configurations.
- **Target API Resource**: The `GcpCloudCdn` resource defining the desired Cloud CDN configuration, including project ID and credential specifications.
- **GCP Credential**: Specifications for the GCP credentials used to authenticate and authorize Pulumi operations, ensuring secure interactions with GCP services.

### Exported Outputs

Upon successful execution, the module exports the following outputs to `status.outputs`:

- **Resource ID**: The unique identifier assigned to the created Cloud CDN resource, which can be used for management and monitoring purposes.
- **Endpoint URL**: The endpoint URL of the Cloud CDN service, facilitating client interactions and content delivery.

These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, provide essential information for monitoring and management, and enable automation workflows to utilize the deployed Cloud CDN resources effectively.
