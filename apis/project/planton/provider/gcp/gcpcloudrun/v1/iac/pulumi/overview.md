# Overview

The **GCP Cloud Run Pulumi Module** is designed to streamline the deployment and management of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Cloud Run services within a multi-cloud infrastructure. Leveraging Planton Cloud's unified API framework, this module models each API resource using a Kubernetes-like structure with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. The `GcpCloudRun` resource encapsulates the necessary specifications for provisioning Cloud Run configurations, enabling developers to manage their serverless applications as code with ease and consistency.

By utilizing this Pulumi module, developers can automate the creation and configuration of GCP Cloud Run services based on defined specifications such as project ID and credential configurations. The module seamlessly integrates with GCP credentials provided in the resource definition, ensuring secure and authenticated interactions with GCP services. Additionally, the outputs generated from the deployment, including service URLs and resource identifiers, are captured in the resource's `status.stackOutputs`. This facilitates effective monitoring and management of Cloud Run services directly through the `GcpCloudRun` resource, enhancing operational efficiency and infrastructure visibility.
