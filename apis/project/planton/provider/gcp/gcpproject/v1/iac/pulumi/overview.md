The `GcpProject` component in ProjectPlanton unifies the creation and management of Google Cloud projects. With a single
YAML manifest, you can define core settings such as project ID, organization or folder parent, billing account, labels,
and default network behavior. This streamlined approach uses Protobuf-based validations to catch misconfigurations early
and translates seamlessly to either Pulumi or Terraform under the hood.

By consolidating these tasks into one resource, `GcpProject` helps maintain a consistent experience across your
multi-cloud deployments. Whether you are provisioning new GCP environments or automating project-level security
hardening, this component reduces overhead, enforces best practices, and fits naturally into the larger ProjectPlanton
ecosystem.
