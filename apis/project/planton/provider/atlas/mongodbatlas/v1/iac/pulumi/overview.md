# Overview

The Pulumi module for MongoDB Atlas within the Planton Cloud ecosystem allows developers to easily configure and deploy MongoDB Atlas clusters by leveraging a well-structured API resource definition. This module takes in an API resource in YAML format, detailing the desired MongoDB Atlas cluster configuration, including project ID, cluster type, electable nodes, and more. The Pulumi engine utilizes these inputs to interact with the appropriate cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and provisions the resources accordingly, as defined in the `spec`. Key outputs like cluster IDs and connection endpoints are captured and returned in `status.outputs`, making it seamless for developers to manage complex infrastructure as code.

Additionally, the module is designed to integrate with Planton Cloud's unified API structure, which provides a standardized approach to defining infrastructure resources. This means that developers can deploy MongoDB Atlas clusters using a single YAML file, without needing deep knowledge of Pulumi or the underlying cloud provider specifics. The command-line tool "planton pulumi up --stack-input <api-resource.yaml>" simplifies the process by either selecting the default Pulumi module for MongoDB Atlas or allowing developers to specify a custom Git repository for advanced configurations.
