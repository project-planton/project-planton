# Microservice Kubernetes Pulumi Module


### Pulumi Module Features

- **Automated Kubernetes Provider Setup**: Utilizes provided credentials and configurations to set up the Pulumi Kubernetes provider automatically, enabling seamless and secure interactions with Kubernetes clusters across different cloud environments.
  
- **Microservice Deployment**: Streamlines the creation and management of microservices by interpreting the `MicroserviceKubernetes` API resource specifications. This includes setting up Kubernetes resources such as Deployments, Services, and Ingresses based on the defined configurations.

- **Resource Management**:
  - **Container Management**: Handles the creation and configuration of containerized applications, ensuring that specified images, ports, and resource allocations are correctly applied.
  - **Networking Configuration**: Manages the setup of network protocols and port mappings, facilitating proper communication between services and external clients.
  - **Environment Variable Injection**: Integrates environment variables and secrets into the deployed containers, enabling dynamic configuration and secure handling of sensitive information.

- **Exported Stack Outputs**: Captures essential outputs including deployment statuses, service endpoints, and resource identifiers in `status.stackOutputs`. These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, enabling effective monitoring, management, and automation workflows.

- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designed to accommodate a wide range of microservice architectures, the module supports varying levels of complexity and can be easily extended to meet evolving infrastructure demands, ensuring long-term adaptability.

- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to promptly identify and report issues encountered during deployment or configuration processes, aiding in swift troubleshooting and maintaining infrastructure integrity.

## Examples

### Basic Example

This example demonstrates a basic setup of a microservice with minimal configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: MicroserviceKubernetes
metadata:
  name: todo-list-api
spec:
  environmentInfo:
    envId: my-org-prod
  version: main
  container:
    app:
      image:
        repo: nginx
        tag: latest
      ports:
        - appProtocol: http
          containerPort: 8080
          isIngressPort: true
          servicePort: 80
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 2000m
          memory: 2Gi
```

### Example with Environment Variables

This example includes environment variables to configure the application.

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: MicroserviceKubernetes
metadata:
  name: todo-list-api
spec:
  environmentInfo:
    envId: my-org-prod
  version: main
  container:
    app:
      env:
        variables:
          DATABASE_NAME: todo
      image:
        repo: nginx
        tag: latest
      ports:
        - appProtocol: http
          containerPort: 8080
          isIngressPort: true
          name: rest-api
          networkProtocol: TCP
          servicePort: 80
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 2000m
          memory: 2Gi
```

### Example with Environment Secrets

This example integrates environment secrets managed by Planton Cloud's GCP Secrets Manager.

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: MicroserviceKubernetes
metadata:
  name: todo-list-api
spec:
  environmentInfo:
    envId: my-org-prod
  version: main
  container:
    app:
      env:
        secrets:
          # value before dot 'gcpsm-my-org-prod-gcp-secrets' is the id of the gcp-secret-manager resource on planton-cloud
          # value after dot 'database-password' is one of the secrets list in 'gcpsm-my-org-prod-gcp-secrets' is the id of the gcp-secret-manager resource on planton-cloud
          DATABASE_PASSWORD: ${gcpsm-my-org-prod-gcp-secrets.database-password}
        variables:
          DATABASE_NAME: todo
      image:
        repo: nginx
        tag: latest
      ports:
        - appProtocol: http
          containerPort: 8080
          isIngressPort: true
          name: rest-api
          networkProtocol: TCP
          servicePort: 80
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 2000m
          memory: 2Gi
```

### Example with Empty Spec

If the `spec` field is empty, the module is not completely implemented. Below are example configurations, though they may not function as expected.

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: MicroserviceKubernetes
metadata:
  name: incomplete-service
spec: {}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: MicroserviceKubernetes
metadata:
  name: another-incomplete-service
spec: {}
```

## Module Details

### Input Configuration

The module expects a `MicroserviceKubernetesStackInput` which includes:

- **Pulumi Input**: Configuration details required by Pulumi for managing the stack, such as stack names, project settings, and any necessary Pulumi configurations.
- **Target API Resource**: The `MicroserviceKubernetes` resource defining the desired microservice configuration, including environment, version, container specifications, and resource allocations.
- **Kubernetes Credentials**: Specifications for the Kubernetes credentials used to authenticate and authorize Pulumi operations, ensuring secure interactions with Kubernetes clusters.

### Exported Outputs

Upon successful execution, the module exports the following outputs to `status.stackOutputs`:

- **Deployment Status**: Information regarding the deployment status of the microservice, enabling users to monitor the progress and health of their applications.
- **Service Endpoints**: The endpoints exposed by the microservice, facilitating access and integration with other services or external clients.
- **Resource Identifiers**: Unique identifiers for the deployed Kubernetes resources, enabling precise management and monitoring within the cluster.

These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, provide essential information for monitoring and management, and enable automation workflows to utilize the deployed microservices effectively.
