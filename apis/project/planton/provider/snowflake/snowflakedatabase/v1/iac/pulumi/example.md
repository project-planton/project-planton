# Snowflake Database Pulumi Module

## Examples

### Basic Example

This example demonstrates a basic setup of a Snowflake database with minimal configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: SnowflakeDatabase
metadata:
  name: analytics-db
spec:
  snowflake_credential_id: snowflake-cred-123
  catalog: default_catalog
  comment: "Analytics database for reporting"
  data_retention_time_in_days: 30
  default_ddl_collation: "en_US"
  drop_public_schema_on_creation: false
  enable_console_output: true
  external_volume: "external_vol_1"
  is_transient: false
  log_level: "INFO"
  max_data_extension_time_in_days: 10
  name: analytics_db
  quoted_identifiers_ignore_case: true
  replace_invalid_characters: false
  storage_serialization_policy: "COMPATIBLE"
  suspend_task_after_num_failures: 3
  task_auto_retry_attempts: 2
  trace_level: "OFF"
```

### Example with Advanced Configuration

This example includes advanced configurations such as environment isolation and detailed security settings.

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: SnowflakeDatabase
metadata:
  name: finance-db
spec:
  snowflake_credential_id: snowflake-cred-finance
  catalog: finance_catalog
  comment: "Finance database for transactional data"
  data_retention_time_in_days: 90
  default_ddl_collation: "en_US"
  drop_public_schema_on_creation: true
  enable_console_output: false
  external_volume: "external_vol_finance"
  is_transient: true
  log_level: "DEBUG"
  max_data_extension_time_in_days: 15
  name: finance_db
  quoted_identifiers_ignore_case: false
  replace_invalid_characters: true
  storage_serialization_policy: "OPTIMIZED"
  suspend_task_after_num_failures: 5
  task_auto_retry_attempts: 3
  trace_level: "ALWAYS ON"
```

### Example with Environment Secrets

This example integrates environment secrets managed by Planton Cloud's [Snowflake Secrets Manager](https://buf.build/project-planton/apis/docs/main:cloud.planton.apis.code2cloud.v1.snowflake.snowflakedatabase).

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: SnowflakeDatabase
metadata:
  name: secure-db
spec:
  snowflake_credential_id: snowflake-cred-secure
  catalog: secure_catalog
  comment: "Secure database with sensitive configurations"
  data_retention_time_in_days: 60
  default_ddl_collation: "en_GB"
  drop_public_schema_on_creation: false
  enable_console_output: true
  external_volume: "external_vol_secure"
  is_transient: false
  log_level: "WARN"
  max_data_extension_time_in_days: 20
  name: secure_db
  quoted_identifiers_ignore_case: true
  replace_invalid_characters: true
  storage_serialization_policy: "COMPATIBLE"
  suspend_task_after_num_failures: 4
  task_auto_retry_attempts: 1
  trace_level: "EVENT OFF"
  env:
    secrets:
      # value before dot 'snowflakesm-secure-env-snowflake-secrets' is the id of the snowflake-secret-manager resource on planton-cloud
      # value after dot 'db-password' is one of the secrets list in 'snowflakesm-secure-env-snowflake-secrets' is the id of the snowflake-secret-manager resource on planton-cloud
      DB_PASSWORD: ${snowflakesm-secure-env-snowflake-secrets.db-password}
    variables:
      ADMIN_USER: admin
```

### Example with Empty Spec

If the `spec` field is empty, the module is not completely implemented. Below are example configurations, though they may not function as expected.

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: SnowflakeDatabase
metadata:
  name: incomplete-db
spec: {}
```

```yaml
apiVersion: code2cloud.planton.cloud/v1
kind: SnowflakeDatabase
metadata:
  name: another-incomplete-db
spec: {}
```

## Module Details

### Input Configuration

The module expects a `SnowflakeDatabaseStackInput` which includes:

- **Pulumi Input**: Configuration details required by Pulumi for managing the stack, such as stack names, project settings, and any necessary Pulumi configurations.
- **Target API Resource**: The `SnowflakeDatabase` resource defining the desired database configuration, including catalog settings, data retention policies, and security configurations.
- **Snowflake Credential**: Specifications for the Snowflake credentials used to authenticate and authorize Pulumi operations, ensuring secure interactions with Snowflake services.

### Exported Outputs

Upon successful execution, the module exports the following outputs to `status.stackOutputs`:

- **Database ID**: The unique identifier assigned to the created Snowflake database, which can be used for management and monitoring purposes.
- **Bootstrap Endpoint**: The endpoint used by Snowflake clients to connect to the database (e.g., `https://pkc-00000.us-central1.gcp.snowflake.cloud:443`), facilitating client interactions.
- **Confluent Resource Name (CRN)**: The Confluent Resource Name of the Snowflake database (e.g., `crn://snowflake.cloud/organization=1111aaaa-11aa-11aa-11aa-111111aaaaaa/environment=env-abc123/cloud-database=ldb-abc123`), serving as a unique identifier within Snowflake Cloud.
- **REST Endpoint**: The REST endpoint of the Snowflake database (e.g., `https://pkc-00000.us-central1.gcp.snowflake.cloud:443`), enabling RESTful interactions with the database for management and monitoring.

These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, provide essential information for monitoring and management, and enable automation workflows to utilize the deployed Snowflake resources effectively.
