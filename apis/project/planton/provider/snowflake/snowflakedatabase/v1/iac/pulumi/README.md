# Snowflake Database Pulumi Module

## Key Features

### API Resource Features

- **Standardized Structure**: The `SnowflakeDatabase` API resource adheres to a consistent schema with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. This uniformity ensures compatibility and ease of integration within Kubernetes-like environments, promoting seamless workflow incorporation and tooling interoperability.
  
- **Configurable Specifications**:
  - **Snowflake Credential ID**: Securely reference the Snowflake credentials required to set up the Pulumi provider, ensuring authenticated and authorized interactions with Snowflake services.
  - **Catalog Configuration**: Define the default catalog for Iceberg tables, enabling efficient data organization and management.
  - **Data Retention Policies**: Specify the number of days for Time Travel actions and data retention, ensuring compliance with organizational data governance policies.
  - **Collation and Serialization**: Configure default collation settings and storage serialization policies to optimize database performance and interoperability.
  - **Security Settings**: Manage security-related configurations such as IAM bindings, public schema settings, and trace levels to maintain robust data protection and compliance.

- **Validation and Compliance**: Incorporates stringent validation rules to ensure all configurations adhere to established standards and best practices, minimizing the risk of misconfigurations and enhancing overall system reliability.

### Pulumi Module Features

- **Automated Snowflake Provider Setup**: Leverages the provided Snowflake credentials to automatically configure the Pulumi Snowflake provider, enabling seamless and secure interactions with Snowflake resources.
  
- **Database Management**: Streamlines the creation and management of Snowflake databases based on the provided specifications. This includes setting up database parameters such as catalog, data retention, and security settings to align with organizational requirements.
  
- **Environment Isolation**: Manages isolated environments within Snowflake, ensuring resources are organized and segregated according to organizational needs, which aids in maintaining clear boundaries and reducing resource conflicts.
  
- **Exported Stack Outputs**: Captures essential outputs such as the database ID, bootstrap endpoint, Confluent Resource Name (CRN), and REST endpoint in `status.stackOutputs`. These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, enabling effective monitoring, management, and automation workflows.
  
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designed to accommodate a wide range of Snowflake database configurations, the module supports varying levels of complexity and can be easily extended to meet evolving infrastructure demands, ensuring long-term adaptability.
  
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling mechanisms to promptly identify and report issues encountered during deployment or configuration processes, aiding in swift troubleshooting and maintaining infrastructure integrity.

## Installation

To integrate the Snowflake Database Pulumi Module into your project, retrieve it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repo/snowflake-database-pulumi-module). Ensure that you have both Pulumi and Go installed and properly configured in your development environment.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/snowflake-database-pulumi-module.git
cd snowflake-database-pulumi-module
```

## Usage

Refer to the [example section](#examples) for usage instructions.

## Module Details

### Input Configuration

The module expects a `SnowflakeDatabaseStackInput` which includes:

- **Pulumi Input**: Configuration details required by Pulumi for managing the stack, such as stack names, project settings, and any necessary Pulumi configurations.
- **Target API Resource**: The `SnowflakeDatabase` resource defining the desired database configuration, including catalog settings, data retention policies, and security configurations.
- **Snowflake Credential**: Specifications for the Snowflake credentials used to authenticate and authorize Pulumi operations, ensuring secure interactions with Snowflake services.

### Exported Outputs

Upon successful execution, the module exports the following outputs to `status.stackOutputs`:

- **Database ID**: The unique identifier assigned to the created Snowflake database, which can be used for management and monitoring purposes.
- **Bootstrap Endpoint**: The endpoint used by Snowflake clients to connect to the database (e.g., `https://pkc-00000.us-central1.gcp.snowflake.cloud:443`), facilitating client interactions.
- **Confluent Resource Name (CRN)**: The Confluent Resource Name of the Snowflake database (e.g., `crn://snowflake.cloud/organization=1111aaaa-11aa-11aa-11aa-111111aaaaaa/environment=env-abc123/cloud-database=ldb-abc123`), serving as a unique identifier within Snowflake Cloud.
- **REST Endpoint**: The REST endpoint of the Snowflake database (e.g., `https://pkc-00000.us-central1.gcp.snowflake.cloud:443`), enabling RESTful interactions with the database for management and monitoring.

These outputs facilitate integration with other infrastructure components, provide essential information for monitoring and management, and enable automation workflows to utilize the deployed Snowflake resources effectively.
