# Overview

The **Azure Key Vault Pulumi Module** enables developers to automate the provisioning and management of Azure Key Vault resources based on the specifications defined in a unified Kubernetes-like API resource model. This module interacts with the Azure cloud provider using Pulumi and sets up an Azure Key Vault along with secrets based on the provided input specifications. The Pulumi module integrates seamlessly with Plantonâ€™s unified API structure, allowing the developer to define their infrastructure in a standard `api-resource.yaml` format and deploy it using the `planton pulumi up` command. The module dynamically creates the required Azure Key Vault resources, and the output is captured in the `status.stackOutputs`, making it easy to track resource creation and configurations.

Key features include support for specifying an `azure_credential_id` to connect securely to Azure, defining a list of secret names to be managed within Azure's Key Vault, and automating secret creation. The Pulumi module accepts input in the form of `AzureKeyVaultStackInput`, which contains the target API resource and relevant Azure credentials. On successful execution, it returns the mapping of secret names to their respective secret IDs in Azure. This module allows for rapid, scalable, and consistent management of key vaults and secrets across different environments while adhering to the unified cloud-native approach offered by Planton.
