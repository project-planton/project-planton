# Overview

The provided Pulumi module is designed to manage the lifecycle of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster through our Unified APIs that mimic Kubernetes' resource modeling. The module accepts an `AksClusterStackInput`, which includes the Pulumi input configurations, the target AKS cluster resource, and Azure credentials. Specifically, it utilizes the Azure credentials from the `stackInput` to instantiate an Azure provider within the Pulumi context. This setup allows the module to securely interact with Azure resources using the provided `ClientId`, `ClientSecret`, `SubscriptionId`, and `TenantId`.

By initializing the Azure provider with these credentials, the module prepares the environment for deploying and managing the AKS cluster as defined in the `api-resource.yaml` file. Although the code snippet focuses on setting up the Azure provider, this step is crucial for any subsequent resource creation and management within Azure. This Pulumi module exemplifies the standardized structure of our APIs and demonstrates how developers can deploy complex infrastructure like AKS clusters using a single YAML configuration, benefiting from consistent documentation available via buf.build.
