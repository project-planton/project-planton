# Create using CLI

Create a yaml manifest using one of the examples below. After the YAML is created, use the command below to apply with
ProjectPlanton:

```shell
project-planton pulumi up --manifest <yaml-path> --stack <stack-name>
```

Or, if using Terraform:

```shell
project-planton terraform apply --manifest <yaml-path> --stack <stack-name>
```

(You can also use a shorter form like `planton apply -f <yaml-path>` if your environment is configured accordingly.)

# Basic Fargate Example

This example deploys a simple ECS service onto an existing ECS cluster using AWS Fargate. It specifies the cluster ARN,
subnets, a single container replica, CPU, and memory.

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsEcsService
metadata:
  name: my-basic-ecs-service
spec:
  clusterArn: "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-existing-cluster"
  container:
    image:
      repo: "nginx"
      tag: "latest"
    port: 80
    replicas: 1
    cpu: 256
    memory: 512
  network:
    subnets:
      - "subnet-123abc"
      - "subnet-456def"
    securityGroups:
      - "sg-123abc"
```

# Example with Environment Variables and Secrets

This example demonstrates how to pass both plain environment variables and secrets to the container.

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsEcsService
metadata:
  name: ecs-service-with-env
spec:
  clusterArn: "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-env-cluster"
  container:
    image:
      repo: "amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"
      tag: "latest"
    port: 8080
    replicas: 2
    cpu: 512
    memory: 1024
    env:
      variables:
        SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: "prod"
        CUSTOM_VAR: "myvalue"
      secrets:
        DB_PASSWORD: "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-1:123456789012:parameter/db_password"
        API_KEY: "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:my-api-key"
  network:
    subnets:
      - "subnet-abc123"
      - "subnet-def456"
    securityGroups:
      - "sg-abc123"
```

# Example with ALB Path-Based Routing

In this example, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) is used to route traffic via a specific path (e.g., `/myapp`). Make
sure your ALB and target ECS cluster are in the same VPC.

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsEcsService
metadata:
  name: path-based-ecs-service
spec:
  clusterArn: "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-load-balanced-cluster"
  container:
    image:
      repo: "nginx"
      tag: "stable"
    port: 80
    replicas: 2
    cpu: 256
    memory: 512
  network:
    subnets:
      - "subnet-111111"
      - "subnet-222222"
    securityGroups:
      - "sg-111111"
      - "sg-222222"
  alb:
    enabled: true
    arn: "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-application-lb/1234567890abcdef"
    routingType: 1  # path-based
    path: "/myapp"
```

---

# Example with ALB Hostname-Based Routing

Use this if you want to route traffic via a dedicated hostname (e.g., `api.example.com`). Ensure your DNS setup points
to
the ALBâ€™s DNS name.

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsEcsService
metadata:
  name: hostname-based-ecs-service
spec:
  clusterArn: "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-hostname-cluster"
  container:
    image:
      repo: "myorg/myservice"
      tag: "v1.2.3"
    port: 8080
    replicas: 3
    cpu: 512
    memory: 1024
  network:
    subnets:
      - "subnet-111aaa"
      - "subnet-222bbb"
    securityGroups:
      - "sg-333ccc"
  alb:
    enabled: true
    arn: "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-other-lb/abcdef1234567890"
    routingType: 2  # hostname-based
    hostname: "api.example.com"
```

# Example with Custom IAM Roles

Here, we show how to specify a custom task execution role for pulling images and a task role for your container to
access AWS services.

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsEcsService
metadata:
  name: ecs-service-with-iam
spec:
  clusterArn: "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/my-iam-cluster"
  container:
    image:
      repo: "amazon/amazon-ecs-sample"
      tag: "latest"
    port: 3000
    replicas: 1
    cpu: 512
    memory: 1024
  network:
    subnets:
      - "subnet-xyz123"
    securityGroups:
      - "sg-xyz123"
  iam:
    taskExecutionRoleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-custom-ecsTaskExecutionRole"
    taskRoleArn: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-app-task-role"
```

After creating a YAML manifest for your ECS service, apply the configuration using either Pulumi or Terraform with the
ProjectPlanton CLI. The CLI will validate your manifest against the Protobuf schema, generate the required
infrastructure code, and provision the service on AWS.

For example:

```shell
project-planton pulumi up --manifest ecs-service.yaml --stack myorg/dev
```

Or:

```shell
project-planton terraform apply --manifest ecs-service.yaml --stack myorg/dev
```

You can verify the newly created ECS service in the AWS Console or with the AWS CLI:

```shell
aws ecs list-services --cluster my-hostname-cluster
```

This confirms that your ECS service has been created, is running the desired number of tasks, and is optionally load
balanced if ALB configuration was provided.

---

P.S If you encounter any issues, please ensure that the specified roles, subnets, and security groups already exist in
your AWS account and that your AWS credentials are configured properly in ProjectPlanton.
