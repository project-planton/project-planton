# Overview

The Pulumi module for AWS RDS Cluster provided by Planton Cloud enables developers to create and manage highly available, scalable, and secure RDS clusters on AWS using a simple API-based approach. This module uses a Kubernetes-like resource modeling system, where the developer inputs an `api-resource.yaml` defining the specifications such as engine type, instance count, security settings, and VPC configurations. The module then interacts with AWS through Pulumi, using credentials specified in the input to create the necessary RDS resources based on the developer's requirements. These resources include RDS clusters, instances, security groups, and autoscaling configurations.

The module leverages the flexibility of Pulumi to capture cloud resource details in the `status.stackOutputs`, making it easy to monitor and manage deployments. Through the CLI command `planton pulumi up --stack-input <api-resource.yaml>`, developers can quickly deploy infrastructure by specifying the repository containing the Pulumi module or using the default module provided by Planton Cloud. The Pulumi output exports critical information like the cluster identifier, master endpoint, and reader endpoint, simplifying the connection and operational processes for developers.
