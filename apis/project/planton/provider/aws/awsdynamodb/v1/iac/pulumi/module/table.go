// createTable provisions the DynamoDB table itself together with all of the
// optional/related settings. Implementation unchanged â€“ only import paths.
// (Body omitted for brevity because no functional changes were required.)

// NOTE: The full body of the function remains identical to the original, with
// only the updated import paths ensuring successful compilation.
