# AWS Security Group Examples

Below are several examples demonstrating how to define an AWS Security Group component in
ProjectPlanton. After creating one of these YAML manifests, apply it with Terraform using the ProjectPlanton CLI:

```shell
project-planton tofu apply --manifest <yaml-path> --stack <stack-name>
```

## Basic Security Group

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsSecurityGroup
metadata:
  name: my-basic-security-group
spec:
  vpcId:
    value: "vpc-12345abcde"
  description: "Basic security group allowing inbound HTTP"
  ingress:
    - protocol: "tcp"
      fromPort: 80
      toPort: 80
      ipv4Cidrs:
        - "0.0.0.0/0"
      description: "Allow HTTP inbound from anywhere"
  egress:
    - protocol: "-1"
      fromPort: 0
      toPort: 0
      ipv4Cidrs:
        - "0.0.0.0/0"
      description: "Allow all outbound"
```

This example creates a basic security group:
• Attaches to VPC vpc-12345abcde.
• Allows inbound HTTP traffic on port 80 from any IPv4 address.

## After Deploying

Once you've applied your manifest with ProjectPlanton tofu, you can confirm that the security group is active via the AWS console or by
using the AWS CLI:

```shell
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-names <your-security-group-name>
```

For detailed security group rules:

```shell
aws ec2 describe-security-group-rules --filters Name=group-id,Values=<your-security-group-id>
```

To list all security groups in your VPC:

```shell
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --filters Name=vpc-id,Values=<your-vpc-id>
```

This will show the security group details including rules, tags, and configuration information.
