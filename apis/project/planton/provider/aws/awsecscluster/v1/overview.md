# Overview

The **AwsEcsCluster** component in ProjectPlanton provides a unified, streamlined way to deploy and manage Amazon ECS
clusters on AWS. It wraps key options—such as Fargate support, container insights, and exec debugging—into a single
resource that integrates seamlessly with the ProjectPlanton multi-cloud framework.

## Purpose and Functionality

- **Simplify Cluster Creation**: Quickly spin up production-ready ECS clusters for containerized workloads, leveraging
  Fargate or EC2 capacity providers.
- **Standardized Configuration**: Consolidate essential ECS settings (e.g., enable Container Insights, ECS Exec) into a
  single spec that is validated against Protobuf schemas.
- **Seamless Multi-Cloud**: Use the same ProjectPlanton CLI and YAML-based workflows you already know, even as you
  deploy other components to various clouds.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automatically manage infrastructure details such as monitoring and capacity, so you can
  focus on application delivery rather than low-level setup.

## Key Benefits

- **Single Manifest, Multiple Providers**: Define your ECS cluster with the same approach you use for Kubernetes, S3, or
  GCS in ProjectPlanton.
- **Flexible Capacity**: Choose either Fargate-only, Spot Fargate, or other capacity providers. Scale up or down without
  custom scripting.
- **Observable & Debuggable**: Optionally enable CloudWatch Container Insights for metrics and logs, and ECS Exec for
  container-level troubleshooting.
- **Consistent Workflows**: Rely on ProjectPlanton’s CLI-driven model for validation, provisioning (Pulumi or
  Terraform), and stack lifecycle management.

Use the **AwsEcsCluster** resource to keep your deployments consistent, reduce operational overhead, and quickly adapt to
changing capacity or monitoring needs. By embracing ProjectPlanton’s standards-based approach, teams can more easily
build, monitor, and debug containerized services at scale.
