# Overview

The provided Pulumi module automates the creation of secrets in AWS Secrets Manager using our Unified APIs that mimic Kubernetes' resource modeling. Specifically, it takes an `AwsSecretsManager` API resource as input, focusing on the `spec` section, which includes the required `aws_credential_id` and a list of `secret_names` to create. The module initializes an AWS provider within the Pulumi context using the supplied AWS credentials. It then iterates over each secret name specified in the `spec`, creating a corresponding secret in AWS Secrets Manager with a placeholder value. The ARNs of the created secrets are exported and captured in `status.stackOutputs`, providing a reference for downstream applications or services.

By leveraging this module, developers can easily manage secrets across multiple cloud environments using a single YAML configuration file. The module integrates seamlessly with our CLI command `planton pulumi up`, simplifying the deployment process. It abstracts the complexities involved in interacting with AWS services, offering a unified and efficient approach to secrets management. This aligns with our goal of providing standardized APIs and comprehensive documentation via buf.build, enabling developers to deploy complex infrastructure components with minimal effort.
