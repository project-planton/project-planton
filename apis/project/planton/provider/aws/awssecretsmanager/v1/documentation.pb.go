//# Overview
//
//The AWS Secrets Manager API resource provides a consistent and streamlined interface for creating and managing secrets within AWS Secrets Manager as part of our cloud infrastructure. By abstracting the complexities of secrets management, this resource allows you to securely store and retrieve sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets effortlessly while ensuring consistency and compliance across different environments.
//
//## Why We Created This API Resource
//
//Managing secrets securely is critical for maintaining the integrity and security of applications. AWS Secrets Manager offers a robust solution, but configuring it correctly can be complex due to the various options and best practices involved. To simplify this process and promote a standardized approach, we developed this API resource. It enables you to:
//
//- **Simplify Secret Management**: Easily create and manage secrets without dealing with low-level AWS configurations.
//- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain uniform secret management practices across different environments and applications.
//- **Enhance Security**: Securely store sensitive information with encryption and control access via AWS IAM policies.
//- **Improve Productivity**: Reduce the time and effort required to manage secrets, allowing you to focus on application development.
//
//## Key Features
//
//### Environment Integration
//
//- **Environment Info**: Integrates seamlessly with our environment management system to manage secrets within specific environments.
//- **Stack Job Settings**: Supports custom stack job settings for infrastructure-as-code deployments.
//
//### AWS Credential Management
//
//- **AWS Credential ID**: Utilizes specified AWS credentials to ensure secure and authorized operations within AWS Secrets Manager.
//
//### Simplified Secret Creation
//
//- **Bulk Secret Creation**: Define a list of secret names to be created in AWS Secrets Manager, streamlining the process of setting up multiple secrets at once.
//- **Consistency Across Environments**: Ensure that all required secrets are consistently created and available in each environment as needed.
//
//### Secure Storage
//
//- **Encryption at Rest**: Secrets are stored encrypted using AWS KMS (Key Management Service), enhancing security for sensitive data.
//- **Version Control**: AWS Secrets Manager keeps track of versions for each secret, allowing for easy rotation and rollback if necessary.
//
//### Access Control
//
//- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Control access to secrets using AWS IAM policies, ensuring that only authorized users and services can retrieve sensitive information.
//- **Integration with AWS Services**: Seamlessly integrate secrets with other AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS, and AWS RDS for secure retrieval at runtime.
//
//## Benefits
//
//- **Enhanced Security**: Centralizes the management of secrets with robust encryption and access control mechanisms.
//- **Simplified Management**: Reduces complexity in creating and managing secrets across different environments.
//- **Consistency**: Ensures that all applications and services have access to the required secrets in a standardized manner.
//- **Compliance**: Helps in meeting regulatory requirements by securely managing sensitive information.
//- **Productivity**: Frees up development and operations teams to focus on core tasks rather than managing secrets infrastructure.
