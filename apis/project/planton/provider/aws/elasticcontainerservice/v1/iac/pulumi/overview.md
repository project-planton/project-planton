# Overview

The AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) Pulumi module enables developers to define and deploy containerized applications on AWS using a standardized, Kubernetes-like API resource model. By specifying configurations in a YAML file, the module automates the provisioning of AWS ECS resources. It accepts the `ElasticContainerService` API resource as input and utilizes Pulumi to create the necessary AWS infrastructure based on the provided specifications, capturing outputs like service endpoints and cluster details in `status.stackOutputs`.

However, since the `spec` in the API resource is currently empty, this module is not fully implemented. Future updates will include detailed configurations for ECS clusters, services, task definitions, and networking settings. This will allow developers to deploy and manage containerized workloads efficiently, leveraging the unified APIs for consistent resource management across multi-cloud environments.
