The **AwsAlb** component in ProjectPlanton offers a unified, streamlined way to provision and manage Application Load
Balancers (ALBs) on AWS. It encapsulates the core AWS ALB settings—like subnets, security groups, and optional DNS/SSL
configuration—into a single resource that fits naturally into the ProjectPlanton multi-cloud framework.

## Purpose and Functionality

- **Automated ALB Provisioning**: Quickly create and configure internet-facing or internal ALBs, handling subnets,
  security groups, and IP address types in one cohesive manifest.
- **Built-In DNS Management**: Optionally manage Route 53 DNS records (e.g., `hostnames`, `route53ZoneId`) to map your
  ALB to custom domains without separate steps.
- **SSL Made Simple**: Enable SSL and specify a certificate ARN in one place, eliminating tedious manual setup.
- **Consistent Multi-Cloud Support**: Use the same CLI and YAML-based workflow as other ProjectPlanton components,
  whether you deploy to AWS or any other supported cloud.

## Key Benefits

- **Simplified Configuration**: Define all critical ALB properties under a single `spec`, with validations and defaults
  guided by ProjectPlanton’s Protobuf schemas.
- **Safe by Default**: Built-in fields such as `enableDeletionProtection` and `idleTimeoutSeconds` reinforce best
  practices and reduce unintentional downtime.
- **Seamless Integration**: Combine **AwsAlb** with other AWS and non-AWS components for holistic multi-cloud
  architectures, all driven by the same CLI commands.
- **Extended Observability**: Easily point domain names to your ALB, enable SSL, and integrate with your existing AWS
  monitoring setup as needed.

Below is a minimal YAML example showing how you might define an ALB (notice the **camel-case** keys):

```yaml
apiVersion: aws.project-planton.org/v1
kind: AwsAlb
metadata:
  name: exampleAlb
spec:
  subnets:
    - subnet-12345
    - subnet-67890
  securityGroups:
    - sg-1111
    - sg-2222
  scheme: internet-facing
  ipAddressType: ipv4
  enableDeletionProtection: false
  idleTimeoutSeconds: 60
  dns:
    enabled: true
    route53ZoneId: Z123456789
    hostnames:
      - alb.mydomain.com
  ssl:
    enabled: true
    certificateArn: arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/abc-123
```

Use the **AwsAlb** resource to seamlessly incorporate AWS load balancing into your multi-cloud environment. By following
ProjectPlanton’s schema validations and standardized CLI workflows, teams can reduce the complexity of configuring ALBs
and ensure consistent, reliable deployments across all their services.

Thanks for reading! By leveraging **AwsAlb**, users can bring consistent load balancing into the same familiar process
they already use for other ProjectPlanton components—allowing simpler operations, better governance, and an easier path
to multi-cloud adoption.
