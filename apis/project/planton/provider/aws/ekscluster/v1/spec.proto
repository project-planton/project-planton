// EksClusterSpec defines the specification required to deploy an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster
// on Planton Cloud.
// This message encapsulates all configurations necessary for setting up an EKS cluster, including the AWS region
// where the cluster will be deployed,
// the VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) settings, and the management mode for worker nodes.
// Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies running Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install,
// operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.
// By providing this specification, users can automate the EKS cluster creation process with specified configurations,
// ensuring a consistent and repeatable setup for their AWS environment.
// This is particularly useful for organizations looking to deploy containerized applications in a scalable and
// highly available manner.
