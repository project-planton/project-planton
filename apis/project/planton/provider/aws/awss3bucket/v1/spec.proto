// including settings for public access and the AWS region where the bucket will be created.
// Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) provides object storage through a web service interface,
// allowing you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
// With this specification, you can automate the creation and configuration of S3 buckets,
// ensuring that your storage resources are correctly set up according to your requirements.
// This is particularly useful for managing large-scale storage needs, hosting static websites,
// or storing data for backup and archiving.

  // When set to `true`, the bucket will be accessible publicly over the internet,
  // allowing anyone to access the objects stored within it.

  // based on AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and bucket policies.
  // Public access should be used cautiously to avoid unintended data exposure.
