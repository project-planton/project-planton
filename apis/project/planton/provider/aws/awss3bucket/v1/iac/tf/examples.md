## After Deploying

Once you've applied your manifest with ProjectPlanton tofu, you can confirm that the S3 bucket is active via the AWS console or by
using the AWS CLI:

```shell
aws s3 ls s3://<your-bucket-name>
```

For detailed bucket information:

```shell
aws s3api get-bucket-location --bucket <your-bucket-name>
```

To check bucket access control:

```shell
aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <your-bucket-name>
```

This will show the S3 bucket details including location, access control, and configuration information.
