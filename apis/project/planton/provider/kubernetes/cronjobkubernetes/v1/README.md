# Overview

The **Cron Job Kubernetes** API resource provides a standardized and streamlined way to deploy cron-jobs onto Kubernetes clusters. This deployment module is designed to simplify the complex process of configuring and managing cron-job deployments by encapsulating all necessary specifications into a single, cohesive resource.

## Purpose

Deploying cron-jobs to Kubernetes can be a complex task involving numerous configurations for containers, networking, scaling, and more. The Cron Job Kubernetes API resource aims to:

- **Standardize Deployments**: Offer a consistent interface for deploying cron-jobs, reducing the learning curve and potential for errors.
- **Simplify Configuration Management**: Consolidate all deployment-related settings into one place, making it easier to manage and update configurations.
- **Enhance Flexibility**: Provide granular control over various deployment aspects to cater to diverse application requirements.

## Key Features

### Container Specification

- **App Container Configuration**: Define the main application container, including:
- **Container Image**: Set the container image, which is computed based on the artifact store and code project path.
- **Resources**: Allocate CPU and memory resources to optimize performance and cost.
- **Environment Variables and Secrets**: Manage configuration data and sensitive information securely.
- **Ports**: Configure container and service ports, including network and application protocols.

- **Sidecar Containers**: Include additional sidecar containers to extend functionality, such as logging agents or proxies.

## Benefits

- **Consistency Across Deployments**: By using a standardized API resource, deployments become more predictable and maintainable.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Developers and DevOps teams can manage cron-job deployments without dealing with intricate Kubernetes configurations directly.
- **Scalability**: Built-in support for autoscaling ensures that cron-jobs can handle varying loads efficiently.
- **Security**: Securely manage sensitive information like credentials and secrets within the deployment specifications.
