# Overview

The Prometheus Kubernetes Pulumi module automates the deployment of Prometheus monitoring systems in Kubernetes clusters. By using Kubernetes credentials and Pulumi's infrastructure-as-code approach, it simplifies the setup of Prometheus, allowing users to configure resource settings, enable data persistence, and manage ingress for external access. The module takes the `PrometheusKubernetes` API resource as input, leveraging Kubernetes-style resource modeling with `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status`. It provisions Prometheus pods, sets up Kubernetes resources like namespaces, and manages persistence options for backing up in-memory data to persistent volumes, making Prometheus highly available and scalable.

Once deployed, the module captures useful outputs like the namespace, service name, and connection details. It supports various access methods, including internal Kubernetes endpoints, public ingress, or port-forwarding, giving flexibility for accessing Prometheus based on security and networking requirements. This module is ideal for multi-cloud environments, providing standardized infrastructure management and consistent deployment patterns using Pulumiâ€™s infrastructure-as-code framework.
