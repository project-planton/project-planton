# Overview

The Pulumi module for RedisKubernetes is meticulously designed to bridge the gap between declarative API resource definitions and actionable cloud infrastructure deployments within a Kubernetes environment. Leveraging the standardized structure of the RedisKubernetesSpec protobuf, the module interprets essential configuration parameters such as the number of Redis replicas, resource allocations, and persistence settings to orchestrate the creation and management of Redis instances across various cloud providers. By integrating seamlessly with Kubernetes cluster credentials, the module ensures secure and efficient provisioning of resources, adhering to best practices and validation rules defined within the specification. This modular approach not only simplifies the deployment process but also promotes consistency and scalability across different environments.

Furthermore, the Pulumi module captures comprehensive outputs in the RedisKubernetesStackOutputs, providing vital information such as service endpoints, port-forwarding commands, and authentication details. These outputs are instrumental for developers to interact with the deployed Redis instances, whether accessing them internally within the Kubernetes cluster or externally via public endpoints. The integration with the unified CLI command `planton pulumi up --stack-input <api-resource.yaml>` empowers developers to deploy complex infrastructures effortlessly by merely specifying a single YAML file. This streamlined workflow, combined with robust documentation available through buf.build, enables rapid setup and deployment of microservices, fostering a highly productive and efficient development lifecycle in the multi-cloud era.
