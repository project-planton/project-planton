# Overview

The PostgresKubernetes Pulumi module is meticulously crafted to automate the deployment and management of PostgreSQL databases within Kubernetes clusters across various cloud providers. By leveraging PlantonCloud's unified API-driven approach and Pulumi's infrastructure as code (IaC) capabilities, this module ensures a seamless and consistent provisioning process. The module accepts a `PostgresKubernetesStackInput` specification, which includes essential configurations such as PostgreSQL container resources, replica counts, disk sizes, and ingress settings. Upon execution, the module initializes the Kubernetes provider using the provided cluster credentials, creates a dedicated Kubernetes namespace, and deploys a highly available PostgreSQL instance using the Zalando PostgreSQL Operator. This setup not only ensures optimal performance and reliability but also adheres to best practices for resource allocation and scalability.

Beyond the core deployment, the PostgresKubernetes module offers advanced features to enhance operational efficiency and security. It supports customizable ingress configurations, allowing secure external and internal access to the PostgreSQL service through load balancers when enabled. The module also manages Kubernetes secrets for database credentials, ensuring sensitive information is securely handled and easily accessible for authorized services. Additionally, the module captures and exports critical outputs such as namespace details, service endpoints, port-forwarding commands, and secret keys, which are stored in `status.stackOutputs`. These outputs facilitate seamless integration with other systems and tools, enabling developers to monitor, manage, and scale their PostgreSQL deployments effortlessly. By encapsulating complex infrastructure provisioning within a standardized and automated framework, the PostgresKubernetes Pulumi module empowers developers to focus on building robust applications without worrying about the underlying database infrastructure.
