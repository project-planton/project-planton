# Overview

The `helm-release-pulumi-module` provides an automated solution for deploying Helm charts on Kubernetes clusters using a declarative approach. It leverages the `HelmRelease` API resource, allowing users to define their Helm chart configurations in a YAML format. This includes specifying the Helm chart repository, version, and values for the Helm input. The module integrates with Pulumi's Go SDK to manage the lifecycle of Helm releases, ensuring that all necessary resources are provisioned and configured on the target Kubernetes cluster.

By utilizing this module, developers and DevOps engineers can deploy Helm charts consistently across environments. The `HelmRelease` API resource is used as the primary input, and the Pulumi module interprets this specification to create or update the Helm release. Key outputs such as the namespace in which the Helm release is deployed are captured and stored in `status.stackOutputs`, providing essential details for managing and accessing the deployed Helm release. This integration streamlines the deployment process and reduces manual intervention, allowing teams to focus on scaling and managing their Kubernetes infrastructure efficiently.
