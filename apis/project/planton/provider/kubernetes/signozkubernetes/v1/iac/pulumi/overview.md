# Overview

The SignozKubernetes Pulumi module is expertly crafted to facilitate the seamless deployment and management of Signoz observability tools within Kubernetes environments across multiple cloud providers. By leveraging the standardized Kubernetes API-resource modeling, the module interprets the `SignozKubernetesSpec` to configure essential parameters such as Kubernetes cluster credentials, enabling secure and efficient provisioning of Signoz resources. This integration ensures that developers can declaratively define their observability infrastructure using familiar Kubernetes constructs, promoting consistency and scalability in multi-cloud setups. The moduleâ€™s design emphasizes modularity and reusability, allowing for streamlined deployments that adhere to best practices and organizational standards.

Additionally, the Pulumi module captures critical outputs within the `SignozKubernetesStackOutputs`, providing valuable information such as the Kubernetes namespace where Signoz is deployed. This output facilitates easy access and management of the deployed resources, enhancing visibility and operational control. The unified CLI command `planton pulumi up --stack-input <api-resource.yaml>` empowers developers to deploy complex observability infrastructures effortlessly by simply specifying a YAML configuration file. With default Pulumi modules readily available and the flexibility to incorporate custom modules via Git repositories, the SignozKubernetes module offers a powerful and adaptable solution for deploying observability tools, backed by comprehensive documentation on buf.build. This approach significantly reduces the complexity of infrastructure setup, enabling developers to focus on building and maintaining robust, observable applications in the multi-cloud era.
