# StackJobRunner Kubernetes Pulumi Module

## Key Features

### 1. **Kubernetes Provider Integration**
   The module creates a Kubernetes provider using the credentials provided in the `api-resource.yaml` file. This allows for secure communication between the Pulumi module and the target Kubernetes cluster, ensuring proper access controls and efficient resource management.

### 2. **Namespace Management**
   The module automatically creates a Kubernetes namespace where the stack job runner is deployed. This isolates the job runner from other workloads and services within the cluster, making it easier to manage and monitor the jobs.

### 3. **Pulumi Infrastructure-as-Code**
   This module is powered by Pulumi, which brings the advantages of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to the job runner deployments. Pulumi provides features like version control, repeatable deployments, and rollbacks, ensuring that stack job deployments can be managed in a predictable and reliable manner.

### 4. **Standardized API-Resource Structure**
   The module adheres to a standardized API resource structure, which mimics Kubernetes' API modeling. This means developers can define their stack job runner using a familiar YAML configuration format that includes:
   - **apiVersion**: Specifies the API version of the resource.
   - **kind**: Defines the type of resource, in this case, `StackJobRunnerKubernetes`.
   - **metadata**: Includes details like the name and labels of the resource.
   - **spec**: Contains the configuration and settings needed for deploying the stack job runner, such as Kubernetes cluster credentials.
   - **status**: Pulumi outputs related to the deployment status, such as the namespace and other important information.

### 5. **Modular and Extendable Design**
   The module is designed to be modular and extendable. It allows developers to define their own custom stack jobs and run them across multiple cloud platforms with minimal effort. As the module takes in an API resource as input, any custom configurations can be easily passed through, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

### 6. **Cloud Provider Agnostic**
   Although this module is primarily designed to run in Kubernetes environments, it is cloud provider agnostic. The Kubernetes provider setup allows the stack job runner to be deployed in any Kubernetes cluster, regardless of whether it is hosted on AWS, GCP, Azure, or any other cloud provider.

### 7. **Simplified Job Management**
   This module streamlines the process of deploying stack jobs. By handling the creation of necessary Kubernetes resources such as namespaces and providers, it reduces the operational overhead involved in running complex jobs. The developer can simply define their job in a YAML file and execute it with the provided CLI command.

## Pulumi Stack Outputs

Upon successful deployment, the module generates several useful outputs, which are captured in the `status.stackOutputs` field. These outputs include:

1. **Namespace**: The Kubernetes namespace where the stack job runner is deployed. This helps in managing and monitoring the resources related to the stack job runner.
2. **Other Outputs**: Any additional outputs generated by the stack job (to be implemented in future releases).

## Usage

Refer to the example section for usage instructions.

## Benefits

1. **Unified API Structure**: By following a consistent API resource structure, this module makes it easier to manage and scale infrastructure deployments across multiple cloud providers.
2. **Infrastructure-as-Code with Pulumi**: Pulumi brings the power of infrastructure-as-code, enabling developers to easily define, deploy, and manage their stack jobs with version control, state management, and automated rollbacks.
3. **Kubernetes Integration**: The module integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes, automating the setup of Kubernetes resources and ensuring that the stack job runners are securely deployed in isolated namespaces.
4. **Cloud Agnostic**: The module supports Kubernetes deployments across any cloud provider, making it highly flexible for multi-cloud environments.
5. **Modular and Customizable**: Developers can extend the module to include custom job configurations, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases.

## Conclusion

The StackJobRunner Kubernetes Pulumi module provides a standardized and efficient way to deploy and manage stack jobs in Kubernetes environments. It integrates deeply with Pulumiâ€™s infrastructure-as-code capabilities, allowing developers to easily configure their deployments with a YAML specification. This module is ideal for developers looking to streamline the process of running complex stack jobs across multi-cloud environments, offering both flexibility and scalability.
