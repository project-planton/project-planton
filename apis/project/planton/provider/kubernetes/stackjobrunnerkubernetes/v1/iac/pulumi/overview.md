# Overview

The StackJobRunner Kubernetes Pulumi module is designed to simplify the deployment of stack jobs within a Kubernetes cluster. It integrates seamlessly with the Kubernetes environment by leveraging the Kubernetes cluster credentials provided in the `stack-input` to create a Kubernetes provider. The module automates the setup process for running stack jobs in Kubernetes, making it easy for developers to deploy and manage complex jobs across different cloud environments using a standardized approach. The key components of the module are modeled using Kubernetes API resource conventions, ensuring a familiar structure for users.

This module also captures and exposes important output details, such as the namespace where the stack job runner is deployed, making it easier for developers to manage and monitor jobs. By taking in a pre-defined YAML specification as input, the module eliminates much of the manual effort involved in setting up and configuring job runners in Kubernetes environments. Its integration with Pulumi provides the added benefits of infrastructure-as-code, such as version control, repeatable deployments, and state management, all while following a consistent pattern for multi-cloud deployments.
