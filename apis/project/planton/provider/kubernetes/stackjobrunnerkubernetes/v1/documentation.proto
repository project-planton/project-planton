//# Overview
//
//The **Stack Job Runner Kubernetes API Resource** provides a consistent and standardized interface for deploying and managing Stack Job Runners on Kubernetes clusters within our infrastructure. This resource simplifies the execution of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) stack jobs in a Kubernetes environment, allowing users to automate deployments, updates, and management of cloud resources efficiently.
//
//## Purpose
//
//We developed this API resource to streamline the deployment and execution of Stack Jobs on Kubernetes clusters. By offering a unified interface, it reduces the complexity involved in setting up and running IaC tasks, enabling users to:
//
//- **Automate Infrastructure Management**: Run stack jobs to deploy and manage cloud resources across different environments.
//- **Simplify Configuration**: Abstract the complexities of setting up Stack Job Runners on Kubernetes, including environment settings and provider configurations.
//- **Integrate Seamlessly**: Utilize existing Kubernetes cluster credentials and integrate with other Kubernetes-native resources.
//- **Optimize Resource Usage**: Efficiently manage resources by leveraging Kubernetes scheduling and scaling capabilities.
//- **Focus on Development**: Allow developers and DevOps teams to concentrate on writing and managing IaC code rather than handling execution environments.
//
//## Key Features
//
//- **Consistent Interface**: Aligns with our existing APIs for deploying open-source software, microservices, and cloud infrastructure.
//- **Simplified Deployment**: Automates the provisioning of Stack Job Runners, including necessary configurations and resource settings.
//- **Seamless Integration**: Works with provided Kubernetes cluster credentials to set up the Kubernetes provider in the stack job.
//- **Scalability**: Leverages Kubernetes to scale Stack Job Runners based on workload demands.
//- **Resource Management**: Allows for efficient scheduling and resource allocation within Kubernetes clusters.
//
//## Use Cases
//
//- **Infrastructure Automation**: Automate the deployment, update, and management of cloud resources using IaC tools within Kubernetes.
//- **Continuous Deployment**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to execute stack jobs as part of continuous deployment processes.
//- **Multi-Cloud Management**: Manage resources across different cloud providers by running stack jobs in a Kubernetes environment.
//- **Environment Consistency**: Ensure consistent execution environments for stack jobs across development, staging, and production.
//- **Resource Optimization**: Utilize Kubernetes features like auto-scaling and resource quotas to optimize the execution of stack jobs.
//
//## Future Enhancements
//
//As this resource is currently in a partial implementation phase, future updates will include:
//
//- **Advanced Configuration Options**: Support for customizing resource requests and limits, node selectors, and tolerations.
//- **Enhanced Security Features**: Integration with Kubernetes RBAC and secret management for secure execution of stack jobs.
//- **Monitoring and Logging**: Improved support for logging and monitoring of stack job executions using Kubernetes-native tools.
//- **Automation and CI/CD Integration**: Streamlined processes for integrating with continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
//- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Expanded usage examples, best practices, and troubleshooting guides.
