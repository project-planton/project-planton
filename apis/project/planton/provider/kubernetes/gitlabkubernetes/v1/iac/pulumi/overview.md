# Overview

The `gitlab-kubernetes-pulumi-module` simplifies the deployment of GitLab within Kubernetes environments. This module accepts a `GitlabKubernetes` API resource, which declaratively defines the configuration for GitLab deployment in a Kubernetes cluster. The module leverages Pulumi to provision all required resources, including the GitLab container, Kubernetes services, and optionally, ingress for external access. The specification allows for detailed control over container resources such as CPU and memory, ensuring that GitLab is optimally deployed based on the provided configuration.

One of the key features of this module is its ability to capture output details such as Kubernetes namespaces, service names, and ingress endpoints. Additionally, it provides port-forwarding commands to securely access GitLab when ingress is disabled. The `planton pulumi up --stack-input <api-resource.yaml>` command automates the provisioning process, ensuring that GitLab is deployed consistently across environments with minimal manual intervention. The outputs from the deployment are stored in `status.stackOutputs`, providing an easy way to access essential information for managing the GitLab instance.
