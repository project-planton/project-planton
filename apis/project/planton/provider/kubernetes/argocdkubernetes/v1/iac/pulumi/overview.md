# Overview

The `argocd-kubernetes-pulumi-module` is designed to simplify the deployment and management of ArgoCD instances within Kubernetes clusters using Pulumi. By utilizing the `ArgocdKubernetes` API resource, developers can declaratively define their ArgoCD deployment in a YAML format, ensuring consistency across environments. The module provisions all necessary Kubernetes resources, including namespaces, services, and ingress configurations, allowing for seamless management of ArgoCD in cloud-native environments.

This Pulumi module is integrated with the Planton Cloud CLI and takes advantage of the unified API structure. Developers can execute the deployment via the command `planton pulumi up --stack-input <api-resource.yaml>`, and if no custom module is specified, the default Pulumi module is used to configure the stack input. The outputs from the module, including the service details, ingress configurations, and access commands (such as port-forwarding), are captured in the `status.stackOutputs` for easy retrieval and management. This pattern provides a reliable and standardized approach to deploying ArgoCD in Kubernetes clusters.
