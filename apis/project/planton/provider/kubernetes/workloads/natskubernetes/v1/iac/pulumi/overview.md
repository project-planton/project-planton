The NATS Kubernetes Pulumi module provides a streamlined, infrastructure-as-code solution for deploying and managing
secure, scalable NATS clusters within Kubernetes. Leveraging Pulumi, the module automates namespace creation, resource
allocation, authentication setup (bearer token or basic auth), JetStream persistence, TLS encryption, and external
access via configurable ingress or LoadBalancer services. It simplifies complex Kubernetes configurations through
standardized YAML-based API resources, offering detailed stack outputs for seamless operational management, ensuring
high availability and reduced administrative overhead.
