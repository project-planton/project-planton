# Overview

The Pulumi module for MongoDB Kubernetes provides a robust and scalable solution for deploying MongoDB clusters on Kubernetes using a unified API resource model. This module allows for a streamlined deployment process by using Helm charts to provision MongoDB resources based on a well-defined Kubernetes specification. The module automates the creation of namespaces, services, and persistent volumes while offering support for ingress, persistence, and customized resource limits. Additionally, sensitive data like passwords are securely managed through Kubernetes secrets and can be customized via Helm chart values.

The MongoDB Kubernetes Pulumi module integrates tightly with Kubernetes providers to dynamically configure and manage MongoDB clusters. It allows developers to configure essential properties like CPU and memory limits, toggle persistence for MongoDB data, and define ingress behavior for external connectivity. The module captures essential outputs, such as Kubernetes service names, internal and external endpoints, and commands for port forwarding, which makes managing and accessing the MongoDB service easy for developers. The inclusion of advanced features like random password generation and Kubernetes secret management further enhances its usability for production-grade environments.
