# Overview

The **Helm Release API resource** provides a consistent and streamlined interface for deploying and managing Helm charts within Kubernetes clusters as part of our cloud infrastructure. By abstracting the complexities of Helm and Kubernetes configurations, this resource allows you to deploy applications effortlessly while ensuring consistency and compliance across different environments.

## Why We Created This API Resource

Deploying applications using Helm charts on Kubernetes can be complex due to various configuration options, dependency management, and environment-specific settings. To simplify this process and promote a standardized approach, we developed this API resource. It enables you to:

- **Simplify Deployment**: Easily configure and deploy Helm charts without dealing with low-level Helm and Kubernetes configurations.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain uniform application deployments across different environments and clusters.
- **Enhance Productivity**: Reduce the time and effort required to set up applications, allowing your team to focus on development.
- **Optimize Resource Management**: Efficiently manage Helm releases and updates through a centralized interface.

## Key Features

### Environment Integration

- **Environment Info**: Integrates seamlessly with our environment management system to deploy Helm releases within specific environments.
- **Stack Job Settings**: Supports custom stack job settings for infrastructure-as-code deployments, ensuring consistent and repeatable provisioning processes.

### Kubernetes Credential Management

- **Kubernetes Cluster Credential ID**: Utilizes specified Kubernetes credentials (`kubernetes_cluster_credential_id`) to ensure secure and authorized operations within Kubernetes clusters.

### Customizable Helm Chart Deployment

#### Helm Chart Specification

- **Repository**: Specify the Helm chart repository (`repo`) from which to fetch the chart. This allows you to use both public and private repositories.
- **Chart Name**: Define the name of the Helm chart (`name`) you wish to deploy.
- **Chart Version**: Specify the version (`version`) of the Helm chart to ensure consistency across deployments.
- **Values Override**: Provide a map of key-value pairs (`values`) to override default Helm chart values, allowing you to customize the deployment to meet specific application requirements.

### Simplified Deployment Process

- **Automated Helm Operations**: Automates the Helm chart installation, upgrade, and rollback processes, reducing manual intervention.
- **Consistent Configuration**: Ensures that all deployments use the same configurations unless explicitly overridden, promoting consistency.

## Benefits

- **Simplified Deployment**: Abstracts the complexities of Helm and Kubernetes configurations into an easy-to-use API resource.
- **Consistency**: Ensures all Helm deployments adhere to organizational standards and best practices.
- **Scalability**: Allows for efficient management of applications as your infrastructure grows.
- **Flexibility**: Customize Helm chart deployments to meet specific application requirements without compromising on best practices.
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Streamlines the deployment process, allowing teams to focus on developing features rather than managing deployments.
- **Centralized Management**: Provides a single interface to manage Helm releases across multiple environments and clusters.
