# Overview

The **Keycloak Kubernetes Pulumi Module** is designed to simplify the deployment of Keycloak instances on Kubernetes clusters. It leverages the Kubernetes-native API resource (`KeycloakKubernetes`) to describe and manage the configuration of Keycloak deployments. This module automates the creation of necessary Kubernetes resources, such as namespaces, services, and ingress configurations, based on the provided specification. With minimal input, developers can deploy a fully functional Keycloak instance, including optional ingress for external access and resource configurations for the Keycloak container.

The module integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes providers, dynamically configuring resources like CPU, memory, and networking based on the `KeycloakKubernetes` specification. Additionally, the module outputs crucial information such as endpoints, port-forwarding commands, and hostnames, making it easy to connect to and manage the deployed Keycloak instance. Whether ingress is enabled or not, the module ensures that developers have the necessary access details for managing their Keycloak instance, supporting both internal and external access patterns.
